Being the Undisputed Universal Champion, Reigns is currently on a 900+ day streak and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. That said, Roman Reigns had to fight a lot of personal battles, including his battle with cancer. Now it seems he has opened up about his cancer diagnosis.</p><p>During an episode of Monday Night RAW back in October 2018, Reigns blew the wind out of fans and pro wrestlers alike when he revealed that he had been diagnosed with leukemia. The Tribal Chief was forced to vacate the Universal Championship and take a break from his wrestling career and get proper treatment. The type of leukemia he had was myeloid leukemia, which is a disease that progresses slowly and is usually detected during routine bloodwork.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Roman Reigns successfully returned to WWE back in February 2019 and revealed that he was in remission and ready to become an active competitor again. Roman Reigns would then square off against Drew McIntyre at WrestleMania 35.</p><p>While speaking with <a href=#>Ariel Helwani of BT Sport</a>, The Tribal Chief reflected on his battle with leukemia. The Head Of The Table revealed how terrifying it was to face leukemia, especially when he was just a small-town boy trying to make his way back home.</p><p>“Well, at first it was terrifying. You know what I mean, because when I initially went through it, nobody knew who I was. I was just a kid from a small beach town, working his way back home to deal with this, with his family. Then to be in this situation where the whole world knows who you are. At the time I didn’t look at it as ‘Man, I’m lucky that I’m gonna have this support,’ it felt more so like, ‘Oh no, they’re gonna judge, they’re gonna make their own narratives,’ You know what I mean. Because in this day and age, people cling on to the negative side of things and toxic stuff, but it was the exact opposite. Everybody surrounded me, just like you said man, everybody was there for me, they supported me. It just really created a safe place for me to just go and heal, and not worry about what anybody thinks or what anybody can say. Just go, dive into my support system, let my family surround me with love and hopefully we just make it back and continue to chase our dream.”</p><p>Roman Reigns will defend his Undisputed Universal Championship against Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 39. It remains to be seen whether The Head Of The Table will be able to retain his titles.
