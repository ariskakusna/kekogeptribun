He's got cool hair, he's a nice height and he just has beautiful blue eyes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At that point, the couple was a fixture at early-aughts nightlife destination Marquee and had been photographed together at Justin Timberlake's since-shuttered restaurant Southern Hospitality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> May I redirect you to this sentence: "the American Idol alum and Gossip Girl star met in May 2007 at the Hollywood nightclub Hyde." This was peak 2007 in every conceivable way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of their reported dates (which of course took place at Marquee) included a show "provided by performers in Oompa-Loompa costumes." Famous singer and up-and-coming actor visit popular nightclub to watch ridiculous-sounding performance art — like, that is an episode of Gossip Girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>Like every Very Cool And Nonchalant Hollywood Couple, Crawford and Underwood refused to actually confirm their relationship. Luckily, Crawford's Gossip Girl co-star Nicole Fiscella said what the pair would not, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, "They're the cutest couple."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anyway, both parties appeared (separately) on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in late 2007. During <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Underwood's visit in November</a>, DeGeneres grilled the singer on whether she'd cook for the cast of Gossip Girl. "Would you cook for Chace, for instance?" she asked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly on the spot, Underwood laughed and said, "I would cook for anyone that would like me to cook for them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And would he like you to cook for him?" DeGenerous prodded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You should call him up and ask him," Underwood told her, noting that she didn't have his number.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">DeGeneres then (of course) presented a paparazzi snap of the couple. "He's right next to you, you could've asked him his number right there!" she joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Crawford visited the show a month later, DeGeneres played a similar trick on the actor. His sister, Candice Crawford, had recently been crowned Miss Missouri, and DeGeneres shared a photo of the beauty queen with the audience. The talk show host then made her movie, telling Crawford, "You know who she looks a little like is Carrie Underwood."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crawford, even less sly than Underwood, said "Really?? Who is that?" in mock surprise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's someone who was here on the show and there was a picture we found of you two … " DeGeneres said. Cue the same awkward sidewalk photo from Underwood's appearance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That's not me!" Crawford joked. "What are you talking about?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked more explicitly whether he was dating anyone, Crawford said "I'm trying to get a pet right now … A panda bear … Maybe a flying squirrel?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The commitment is truly admirable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By February of 2008, Crawford and Underwood's status was unclear. When a reporter asked the Gossip Girl star about his relationship with the singer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he replied</a>, "You're under the assumption that we're dating now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two months later, it was official. Crawford's aforementioned sister told People that the actor was "upset about the breakup. It's always hard when you lose a relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Underwood addressed the split too, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Extra</a> that it was "completely mutual," adding, "We broke up over text so … it's like 'peace out.'" Nate Archibald would never.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It just didn't work," she continued. "We both knew it didn't work and [had] no hard feelings at all whatsoever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, "sources" insisted to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> that it was tad bit more complicated than Underwood had portrayed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Carrie is the one who broke Chace's heart, not the other way around," an insider told the publication. "He flew to visit her, went on tour with her — he did everything he could for this girl."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another fly-on-the-wall said Crawford was the one to break things off: "He was upset, but he also had to make the decision that it wasn't meant to be anymore."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2009, Crawford told People he had "nothing bad to say" about his time with Underwood. "It was awesome," he said. "I just didn't know how to deal with it. I learned a ton about dating someone in that kind of spotlight. It was such a whirlwind, but no regrets."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Underwood and former hockey player Mike Fisher got engaged later that year, Crawford told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Us</a>, "I wish her the best."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a strange turn of events, Crawford's sister ended up marrying former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, Underwood's ex-boyfriend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crawford dated actress Rebecca Rittenhouse for several years before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>splitting in 2018</a>. His current relationship status is unknown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next up for the actor is season 3 of the hit Amazon Original series The Boys out later this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Underwood wed Fisher in 2010. The couple has since welcomed two sons together: Isaiah, 6, and Jacob, 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer's eighth studio album, My Savior, will be released on March 26, 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2abkae%2FqrGMrqWdnaKsvLCwjJyfmpuVYrCzrdafpqucXaeyra3Toqanq5ievQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deborah-ann-woll-net-worth-details-about-movie-career-bf-age-income.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deborah Ann Woll Net Worth: Details About Movie, Career, Bf, Age, Income - SarkariResult</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-drive-a-tractor-over-a-leach-field-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can you drive a tractor over a leach field?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
