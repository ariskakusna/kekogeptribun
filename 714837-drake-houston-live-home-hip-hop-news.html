After all, with all that money and fame, you'd be hard-pressed to find a property of his liking that he wouldn't pull up to. However, as Drizzy announced during <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his latest Houston stop of his It's All A Blur tour</a> with 21 S*vage, it seems like he's found the place he's been looking for. Moreover, he announced to the crowd that he found a place to stay in Houston, much to their excitement. Under the tutelage of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bun B</a> and a lot of stylistic inspiration in his early days, H-Town has a special place in the 36-year-old's heart.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Also, I want to tell you something," Drake told the crowd, presumably on Monday (September 18) at his second concert in the city in a row. "I'm excited I get to share this with night two. I had to make it official first. I've been looking for a long time. Trying to figure out, you know, the right place for me to live where I belong outside of Toronto. I finally, finally, after all these years, found me a place in Houston, Texas. So y'all will be seeing me a lot, yeah!"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-is-moving-into-a-houston-crib-for-his-u-s-travels-outside-of-toronto>Drake Is Moving Into A Houston Crib For His U.S. Travels Outside Of Toronto</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What's more is that this isn't all the love that Drake had to show to the city during these shows. "They say I'm from Toronto, Canada, but we might have to check the hospital records," the 6 God cheekily expressed during his concert. "'Cause y'all show me too much love in the H-Town, I love y'all for real. I got my album coming out for y'all October 6. I know I pushed it back, but it's for good reason. 'Cause <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I'm trying to represent for the H-Town like I always do</a>. Another classic on the way."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With this in mind, fans are more excited than ever for the release of the "classic" in question, For All The Dogs. It's been a long time since he announced it, and delays and constant touring have kept fans at bay. Regardless of all that, it's heartening to see that the OVO head honcho finally gets to take in a pivotal city in his life and career.
