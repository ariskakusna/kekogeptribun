The young woman was vacationing in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends last month. Just a day after arriving, staff found her dead in her hotel room. Initially, the girl's travel mates told her parents that alcohol poisoning was the cause of her death. However, her father believes otherwise.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While chatting with TMZ, the North Carolina native's dad, Bernard Robinson, got emotional as he spoke about the latest updates Shanquella's family has received from the Mexican authorities. Rather than from drinking, it seems the late woman's cause of death was blunt force trauma to her neck and spine.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In recent days, a video proving this point has been making rounds online. The now-viral clip shows Shanquella naked in a hotel room as a woman aggressively beats her up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bernard assured the outlet that his daughter was "not the fighting type." He also said she would never get into any sort of physical altercation. This, paired with the new video, has led him to speculate that his only child's demise was a part of a planned attack.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The incriminating footage lines up with the Robinson family patriarch's memories of Shanquella. She doesn't appear to fight back during the assault. Her dad believes the entire thing was part of a "setup." He added that "her friends back home would never have let this happen."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While the video is undoubtedly hard for anyone to watch, it's particularly difficult for Bernard, who is experiencing immense pain knowing that others were idly watching in the room while his daughter was attacked.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ultimately, the Robinsons hope to see those who are responsible taken into custody accordingly and then given a life sentence in prison.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Additionally, we now know that Shanquella's autopsy report makes no mention of alcohol. The Mexican authorities and the FBI are now working together to investigate her death as a homicide.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check back in with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">HNHH</a> later for any updates.
