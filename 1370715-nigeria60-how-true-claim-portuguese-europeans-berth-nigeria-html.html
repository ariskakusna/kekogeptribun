The thing is people no longer use this kind of terminology again just as it is no longer tenable to say that Mungo Park discovered River Niger.”<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Though Portugal did not colonise Nigeria, the claim that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to berth in the country is correct.</p><p class=align-left>Though there was no country called Nigeria at the time, there are historical records that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to make contact with the people on the West Coast of Africa in the 15th century, particularly the territory that would later become Nigeria. The re-naming of Eko as Lagos, a port city in Portugal is an illustration of the early influence of Portuguese culture on Nigeria’s western coast.</p><p class=align-left>However, the claim that the Portuguese “discovered” Nigeria is erroneous. First, there was no country named Nigeria at the time. Nigeria as a nation is a creation of the British imperialists.</p><p class=align-left>Second, the Portuguese met people with organised and independent indigenous administrations and only had economic relations with them until the British colonial invasion.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>The researcher produced this article per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Legit.ng to facilitate the ethos of "truth" in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.</i></strong></p><p class=align-left>What's the most exciting thing about being a Nigerian? | Legit TV</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnSDj3BobmWenrSmvsiabWllmKTEbsDRrpxmm5yWtq55z6ipra2XqrK0sYyerKunoJqur7%2BMm5yrrJhiu6qzxKugmmaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1595761-airport-nigerian-lady-cabin-crew-member-shares-learnt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Lady Shares Trainings She Took to Achieve Dream of Becoming Cabin Crew Member</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1242956-myunical-ng-unical-portal-login-admission-checker-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>myunical.edu.ng | UNICAL portal login and admission checker</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
