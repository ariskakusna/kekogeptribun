Sony Pictures could inject an additional $50 million, giving Robinov $300 million.</p><p><strong>PHOTOS <a href=#>Hollywood’s Season of Firings</a></strong></p><p>One source says Robinov has been offered more than the $300 million in equity that he was seeking. He is said to be assembling that amount in various increments from interested parties. In addition to Chinese companies, he also is in talks with potential European investors and strategic partners.</p><p>“Jeff is trying to build a real production company, not just a slate of films, similar to what Legendary or Skydance have done,” said a source attending the Shanghai <a href=# id=auto-tag_international data-tag=international>International</a> Film Festival.</p><p>Robinov has declined to comment on ongoing negotiations due to the fluidity and complexity of such deals.</p><p>The original Huayi deal would have injected up to $150 million into Robinov’s Studio 8, which would have been one of the biggest China-Hollywood team-ups so far.</p><p>Robinov has also had talks with the e-commerce company Alibaba, which is about to go public in the biggest tech listing ever and is keen to expand its involvement in the film business. There have also been discussions with the L.A.- and Beijing-based production company DMG and the Chinese distribution and production outfit Bona.</p><p>An announcement that a deal was done had been widely expected at Cannes.</p><p><strong>VIDEOS&nbsp;<a href=#>Most Anticipated Summer Blockbusters</a></strong></p><p>Huayi Bros. was formed in 1994 and has grown into an entertainment conglomerate, with interests in film, TV, music, advertising and talent management. The company is known to have been seeking co-production and co-financing partners abroad.</p><p>Huayi had announced a deal with Legendary Pictures in 2011, but the deal foundered.</p><p>The company was behind two of 2013’s biggest movies at the Chinese box office, Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons and Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon. The company’s 2013 net profit more than doubled to $109 million.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKuxxZ9kq6eSnruwwoyco6irlWKxpq3LZqCnrpWowbC%2B0mZuamtmaX1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerrika-karlae-age-wiki-biography-height-in-feet-boyfriend-net-worth-child-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jerrika Karlae Age, Wiki, Biography, Height in Feet, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Child</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-richardson-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Richardson Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
