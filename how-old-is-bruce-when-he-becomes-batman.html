He turns 26 in February, making him 26 when he debuts as Batman in April.</span></span><h2>At what age Bruce Wayne become Batman?</h2>Just like Batman: Year One takes place over the course of 12 months, it can be deduced that Bruce Wayne was approximately 26 years old when he became Batman. The series also reveals he waited 18 years to become Batman, placing him at around eight-years-old when he saw his parents being killed.<h2>How old is Bruce Gotham?</h2>That could mean that Gotham is following a clear two-years-per-season timeline, though, as that would put Bruce at 12 in season 1, 14 in season 2, 16 in season 3, and in this season, 18 and just about ready to graduate high school.<h2>How old was Bruce when he stopped being Batman?</h2>-Bruce has been retired from Batman for 10 Years. - James Gordon is retiring from GCPD at Age 70. This reveals that during the events of the series that Bruce Wayne was 48 and he retired at age 38 because of the death of Jason Todd.<h2>How old was Bruce Wayne when he started his training?</h2>At the age of 14, Bruce leaves Gotham City to explore and obtain skills in martial arts and forensics. Scenes of his early training as a teenager are depicted, including experiences with college, and a disillusioning experience in working with the FBI upon turning 20.<h2>This Is How Bruce Wayne Became The Batman | Batman: Year One</h2><p></p><h2>Who was the oldest Batman?</h2>Meanwhile, George Clooney, Adam West, and Val Kilmer were also in their mid to late 30s while portraying their take on Batman.

In the film, we watch as he interacts with a young Bruce Wayne of about nine or 10 years old. If Pattinson's Batman is in his 30s, that would leave Phoenix's Joker in a future movie somewhere in his 50s—closer to the actor's actual age.<h2>How old was Robin when he became Robin?</h2>at 30, Batman finds 9-year old Dick Grayson after his parents die in the circus and takes him in. Dick becomes Robin at 12 while Batman is 32.<h2>How old is Batman Titans?</h2>Typically, at the stage where Jason Todd becomes Robin, Bruce Wayne is still in his late 30s at the oldest.

This would make sense as Zoë Kravitz is 33 years old, while Robert Pattinson is 35, reasonably placing both characters in their early 30s.</p><h2>Is Superman older than Batman?</h2>Superman is a year older than Batman. The character debuted in 1938 for DC Comics and was an instant hit, so the creation of more superheros followed, including Batman in 1939.<h2>Is Joker older than Bruce Wayne?</h2>The Joker was initially depicted as being much older than Batman. However, The Killing Joke presented his origin as a young comedian with a pregnant wife, and he was about 25 in it. This was nine years before the common DC canon, making him 34 now, so maybe the Joker is the same age as Batman.<h2>Who does Batman think is the best Robin?</h2>SPOILER WARNING for Batman Secret Files: The Signal #1!<p>Tim Drake is widely considered to be the best Robin amongst DC fans and apparently Batman agrees.</p><h2>Who is the youngest Robin?</h2>Dick Grayson was the original Robin. Jason Todd was the Robin who died. And Tim was the youngest Robin, Batman's partner. More independent than Dick and more empathetic than Jason, Tim simply was Robin for two decades of readers, as well as the enormous audience of Batman: The Animated Series.<h2>Does Batman still love Jason Todd?</h2>Batman and Jason Todd have long had a fractured relationship after the former Robin was killed and brought back to life. Jason harbors understandable resentment towards Bruce Wayne, but it's clear he still cares - apparent by a heartbreaking gift he just gave to Batman.<h2>Why is The Batman 15?</h2>The British Board of Film Classification determines ratings in the U.K. and deemed The Batman a 15 film because it includes "strong threat" and violence.<h2>Who is the youngest Batman?</h2>Wilson.

Reeves has since revealed that the character, played by actor Barry Keoghan, is The Joker.<h2>Who is the best Batman ever?</h2>Despite only acting in three Batman movies, Christian Bale is the most popular opinion among fans as the best Batman of all time. This is in part because of Bale's incredible performance in all three movies as Batman/Bruce Wayne, and also partially due to the unbelievably high quality of all three films in the series.<h2>How old is Batman in Batman vs Superman?</h2>We're glad that's out of the way and while it's just a general age, mid-40s is definitely not the 50+ that we were hearing originally. Affleck is actually only 41, so he's a little younger than where his character is set to be in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.<h2>How old is Batman in all the movies?</h2>While the final version of The Batman may of course reveal something different, prior reports have said that writer/director Matt Reeves' script places Bruce Wayne right around 30-years-old. Robert Pattinson is currently 34, so he's not far off from that mark.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormannJl6qr%2BMm6mum5VixKmxzWafnmWSmrCwucSsZJuZpKKurw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./broken-capillaries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Get Rid of Broken Capillaries On Your Face</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-shane-battier-make-latest-shane-battier-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Shane Battier Make?
