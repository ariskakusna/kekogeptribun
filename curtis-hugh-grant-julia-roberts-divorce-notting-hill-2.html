podcast, Curtis revealed: “Recently I wrote - I was going to do it for Comic Relief but it wasn’t good enough - I wrote Notting Hill 2.”</p><p>The 66-year-old added: “[It] was going to be a 10-minute special set in the divorce lawyer’s office with Hugh and Julia splitting up, and then they both realised they loved each other again.”</p><p>However, he admitted that making a sequel to <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>a beloved romantic comedy</a> was “a tricky road to go down”.</p><p>Curtis said: “I do think the second version of a romantic film is a tricky thing because what you do is you start with people who are together and you have to split them apart and then you have to put them back together again.”</p><p>Pressed on whether that is why he had never done a sequel to his beloved romantic comedies, he said: “Very much so, my daughter talks a lot about the fact that none of the people in any of my film’s marriages would have lasted longer than about three weeks.”</p><p>He added: “The problem with dramas about marriages is that it’s always literally got to be about either divorce or murder and yet the situation with most marriages is that they just go on and on and on.</p><p>“Actually the most realistic versions…of how marriage potters along, often I think happens in comedies.”</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Curtis and his daughter Scarlett</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: PAUL NICHOLLS</span></figure><p>The screenwriter, producer and director also told the TV reviews podcast hosts that <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Love Actually</a> was an “atrocious” film.</p><p>He said: “Love actually is just, be it a good or – as my daughter would say, an atrocious racist, sexist, fattest film – it’s in fact nine romantic comedies done in 10 minutes each.”</p><p>It comes after he has promised <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>never to make “fat” jokes</a> in his work again after being taken to task by his daughter.</p><p>A new generation of Love Actually viewers has been particularly appalled by the hit 2003 film’s depiction of Martine McCutcheon’s character.</p><p>She played Natalie, a tea lady at No10, whose father calls her “Plumpy” and an aide to the prime minister calls her “the chubby girl” with a “pretty sizeable a---”.</p><p>Speaking on stage at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he was interviewed <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>by his 28-year-old daughter, Scarlett</a>, he said: “I remember how shocked I was five years ago when Scarlett said to me, ‘You can never use the word fat again’.</p><p>“And, wow, you were right. In my generation, calling someone ‘chubby’ ... in Love, Actually, there are endless jokes about that. I think I was behind the curve and those jokes aren’t any longer funny.</p><p>“I don’t feel I was malicious at the time but I feel I was unobservant and not as clever as I should have been.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9ramhpYGR%2BenvCrqmtoaNitbazx2aeq5meqXqrwcuimGaqn5eys8DSZpuirp%2BnsKZ5zairraGenHqptculZGtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eva-nyc-hydration-leave-in-conditioner-review-8423137.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Finally Found the Curly Hair Equivalent of a Dry Shampoo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-married-at-29-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Does It Cost To Get Married At The Courthouse In Detroit Michigan</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
