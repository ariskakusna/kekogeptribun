Ahead of the meeting, Stephen recalled that his grandmother had been excited but also nervous, so we can imagine that Kate's kindness was very much appreciated. "She loved it," Stephen said of his grandmother's experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=eryzQ-YV3jE data-wc=43>In the run-up to the engagement, Pat had even bought a new blouse and she also got up extra early to get her hair done. Later in the day, she was then introduced to Kate at a support group session for kinship carers.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiS4WEhriH data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>13 royal wedding reactions caught on camera: From Princess Kate's joy to Prince Harry's grimace</a></p><p id=eK3EEGPWMD data-wc=12><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Kate channels Barbie in candy pink blazer and fitted trousers</a></p><p id=eePeGRjk39K data-wc=53>Speaking about being brought up by his grandmother, Professor Green said: "It was just the done thing. Family doesn't necessarily mean two parents with 2.4 children. My home wasn't broken. The amazing thing about charities like this is it's focusing on early intervention, there's things as a child I would've better coped with."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/a40ba4f17d9d-princess-kate-with-professor-green-nanny-pat.jpg><p id=e6DNzhHFjfu data-wc=33>During the day, Kate also played with children on the floor as she met a group of carers at Saint Pancras Community Association in Camden who have been supported by the charity Kinship.</p><p id=eDyuoSAJOjl data-wc=24>Kinship care is when a child is looked after by their extended family or close friends if they cannot remain with their birth parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54e953a9c39b-gettyimages-1493158585.jpg><p id=ewb1IToqEOK data-wc=48>She also spent part of the day chatting with Bez, who came to the UK from Iran as a teenager and was placed in care after claiming asylum.

"To have her actually come and support this is amazing. She's a very nice person, she's very humble and down to earth and it feels quite natural and comfortable to talk to her," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/878675d4571b-gettyimages-1493151199.jpg><p id=etwWiDIzhgA data-wc=68>Asked what her visit meant to young people in care, he replied: "It means quite a lot because you kind of feel pushed aside to the kerbs of society. Nobody is looking at your talents, your ambitions and your wants and needs are denied. It means a lot to people. Not many care leavers have had experiences in even normal social settings so to meet royalty is big."</p><p id=eVZwygGneWB data-wc=55>The Foundling Museum offers young care-leavers two traineeships each year, an eight-month course in art and a four-month course in creative writing. Trainees are referred by their social workers or charities working with those leaving care and go on to teach family workshops at the Museum and help to teach others coming through the programme.</p><p id=eTJyNP3DNq data-wc=31><strong>Make sure you never miss a royal story!<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to The Royal Explainer newsletter</a> to receive your weekly dose of royal features and other exclusive content straight to your inbox.</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
