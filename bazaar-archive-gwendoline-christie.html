Most actors are slighter creatures than the screen suggests; the opposite is true for Christie, whose physicality is more than just unusual, it's defining. Her stature has shaped her life – aged 11, she gave up competitive gymnastics because of a back injury caused by growing too fast; when she was 14, a doctor offered to cut three inches off her legs to make her 'normal'; later still, she stopped going to school because of bullies who said she was a man dressed in woman's clothing – but now it is transforming her career. From she-knight Brienne of Tarth in the TV epic Game of Thrones – now filming its fifth season, due to screen here in the spring – to roles in 2015's blockbusting instalments of both Star Wars and The Hunger Games ('I'm not allowed to tell you anything about them. I'm sorry, it's so impolite'), this thirtysomething is our British Actress of the Year because she is about to become this country's biggest action star. In many ways, however, Christie's height is the least interesting thing about her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For anyone who has managed to avoid popular culture entirely since 2011, Game of Thrones is a sort of political intrigue set in a fictional universe, and HBO's most popular series ever, beating even The Sopranos. Based on A Song of Ice and Fire – five cult fantasy novels by George RR Martin, who is now frantically writing two more – it's a bloody soap opera with feuds and wars, dungeons and dragons, mythical creatures, morally ambiguous characters and an astonishing amount of sex and savagery. It's compelling stuff, made more so by a strong female cast of all ages playing characters who are just as bloodthirsty as the men. Into this, two years ago, rode Christie as someone described in the books as 'the freakish one, not fit to be son or daughter'. 'I absolutely had to sacrifice my personal vanity,' she says. 'I'm thrilled I did that. You realise quickly that vanity can be quite worthless. When I was younger, I wasn't sure I wanted to act because I was told it would be so hard for me, and possibly not an option at all, because of the way I looked. I leapt at the opportunity to play a character that was so outside the realms of convention. I love the part because it defies gender stereotypes and it defies aspects of femininity that always told me "no".'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Christie grew up in a small village on the South Downs, with parents who were strict, though always supportive. Her late father, also tall, told her she was special, told her: 'You can do anything a man can do,' and she seems to have developed a core of steel beneath the surface vulnerability; her composure is impressive when describing the setbacks and slights she has endured. While she was studying at Drama Centre London, a classical method conservatoire, agents told her she was too big to be cast; she found solace among the glamorous freak show that was the city's club scene at the time. 'It was such a glorious group of exotic misfits, I felt like I had come home because my differences were celebrated. For the first time, I was welcomed with open arms.' A muse of sorts, she appeared nude in a book by the photographer Polly Borland, and was dressed by East End designers who remain her friends to this day (one of whom, Giles Deacon, is now her partner). She still sees fashion as a form of escapism and self-expression.</p><img alt="Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones photographed for Harper's Bazaar" title="Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones photographed for Harper's Bazaar" width=2900 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/17/1461582679-gwendoline-christie-bazaar-2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Trent McGinn for Harper's Bazaar</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was some small success along the way: a few scenes in Terry Gilliam's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus with Heath Ledger and stage experience in a production of Great Expectations at the National Theatre. Christie also worked as an assistant to the actor and director Simon Callow, walking his dogs and cataloguing his CD collection, and though this wasn't what she had trained so hard to do, it strengthened her resolve. 'He educated me,' she says. 'He made me believe that I should be an artist, and that it was valid, and that there was no reason why I shouldn't succeed. He gave me great faith that I would be able to work.'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it was announced that HBO was adapting Game of Thrones, fans of the novels filled online forums with suggestions of who should be cast. Gwendoline Christie was one of those names. She read the books; she decided they were right. 'I lost a stone and a half of weight, stopped drinking, started eating very healthily and worked out all the time,' she says. 'I wanted it.' This was the easiest part: once the role was offered to her, Christie learned how to ride, spent three months mastering fencing and built the kind of muscle that allows you to spend 12 hours a day swordfighting on horseback while wearing a suit of armour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A sixth series of Game of Thrones has already been commissioned and will begin filming this spring; in the meantime, in between working on the previous episodes, Christie filmed her roles in Star Wars and also The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2, the fourth and final part of the series. 'I'm playing Commander Lyme, a previous victor of an unseen Hunger Games,' she says of her character. 'She is now in charge of the rebels in District 2, which is the closest district to the Capitol. Katniss [played by Jennifer Lawrence] was shown footage of Commander Lyme as an example, as inspiration.' Due for release in November 2015, it's Christie's first proper experience of Hollywood, but the sense of empowerment she felt playing Brienne of Tarth hasn't been lost. 'I like the message that The Hunger Games has,' she says. 'I like the fact that this new female icon is about strength and strength of choice. It was a real highlight of my life. For these things to actually happen, it imbues you with such hope of what life can be. I know it sounds corny, but it's true. What a nice year to have!'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This originally appeared in the December 2014 issue of Harper's Bazaar</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>***</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>MORE GAME OF THRONES</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/style-files/news/g36781/game-of-thrones-red-carpet-style/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Game of Thrones style on the red carpet" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Game of Thrones style on the red carpet</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/news/a36780/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-sexism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emilia Clarke hits back at critics who claim&nbsp;Game of Thrones is sexist" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Emilia Clarke hits back at critics who claim&nbsp;Game of Thrones is sexist</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/news/a36827/kit-harington-jon-snow-lie-detector/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Watch Kit Harrington answer your Game of Thrones questions with a lie detector" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Watch Kit Harrington answer your Game of Thrones questions with a lie detector</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7zZ6urGeRaH94gpZomZqykZa%2Fbq3RnJ%2BirpVitLixzZ2mpaGemnqktNGiqq2hlWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-barnes-shadow-and-bone-interview-2023-7480539.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Barnes Has the Range</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alec-baldwin-rock-of-ages-gay-kiss-russell-brand-tom-cruise-335593.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alec Baldwin Talks About His Gay Kiss with Russell Brand at Rock of Ages Premiere</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
