Here's all the fascinating facts:</p><li class=collection__item readability=9><h2 class=title>Who wrote 'Wind Beneath My Wings'?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>The song was written in 1982 by Jeff Silbar and Larry Henley.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The pair recorded a demo of the song, and gave it to musician Bob Montgomery.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Montgomery recorded his own demo version of the song, changing it from the mid-tempo original he was given, to a ballad.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Silbar and Henley then offered it around to many other artists.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=13><h2 class=title>What inspired the song?</h2><p class=paragraph-text>Larry Henley came up with the title and Jeff Silbar was a big fan, particularly as he was learning to fly planes at the time.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The title came from a poem Henley had written. Instead of writing the chorus first (like the pair usually did), they wrote it from start to finish. They finished writing it by the end of the day.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It was initially conceived as a love song from a lover to another, but the lyrics ended up being something more universal, and could apply to various types of relationships, such as friends or family, helping the song's lasting popularity.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=17><h2 class=title>Many artists recorded it before Bette Midler</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/FWS44ZcFZDk/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Roger Whittaker - The wind beneath my wings (1982)</p><p class=paragraph-text>The song was first recorded by Kamahl in 1982 for a country album he was making, but it was not commercially released as didn't quite suit the style.</p><p class=paragraph-text>Instead, Roger Whittaker recorded the song, followed soon after by Sheena Easton and Lee Greenwood.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It also had charted versions by Colleen Hewett (1982), Lou Rawls (1983), Gladys Knight & the Pips (1983), and Gary Morris (1983).</p><p class=paragraph-text>Perry Como also recorded the song for his final album Today a year before Midler received it. He wanted to release it as a single, but RCA refused. Como was apparently so angry, he vowed to never record for the label ever again.</p></li><li class=collection__item readability=17.111111111111><h2 class=title>When did Bette Midler record it?</h2><p class=paragraph-text><a href=#>Bette Midler</a> recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of 1988 drama Beaches, in which she also starred as singer CC Bloom.</p><p class=paragraph-text>The song features in a heartbreaking scene when CC's best friend Victoria passes away due to cancer, after watching the sun setting over the beach.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/oiS8YokFzeY/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Beaches - Wind Beneath My Wings</p><p class=paragraph-text>Who's chopping onions?</p><p class=paragraph-text>However, it was not chosen as the soundtrack's lead single. That was given to Midler's version of 'Under the Boardwalk'.</p><p class=paragraph-text>It was released as the second single in February 1989, after the box office success of the movie. The song quickly became a #1 hit on the US singles chart, and number three in the UK.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/0iAzMRKFX3c/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Bette Midler - Wind Beneath My Wings (Official Music Video)</p><p class=paragraph-text>Midler's version was awarded a platinum disc by the RIAA for sales exceeding one million copies in the US alone.
