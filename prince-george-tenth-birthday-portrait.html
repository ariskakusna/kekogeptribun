smiling for the camera as he sits on steps wearing a button-down shirt and long pants,” the outlet reports. The photo is reminiscent of a series of photos taken in November 2014, when the then one-year-old future king posed on another set of steps at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/kensington-palace/>Kensington Palace</a> in London for portraits released ahead of the Christmas holiday that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/588n7LN6A3xUAupemxVeZT-1920-80.jpg><p>As opposed to Kate—who used to take the annual portraits of not just George but also his younger siblings <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-charlotte/>Princess Charlotte</a> and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-louis-of-cambridge/>Prince Louis</a>—the Wales family has been employing the services of Pilkington often in the past year, including not just George’s birthday portraits this year but also Charlotte's and Louis'.

How can the human body do that? It is utterly extraordinary, actually. And he was very sweet. And I was also sort of relieved that he was a happy, healthy boy.”</p><p>The next day, William and Kate introduced their son—whose name had still not been announced publicly—on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s to the waiting public in a moment that Kate recalled was “slightly terrifying, I’m not going to lie,” she said on “Happy Mum, Happy Baby.” She continued “Everyone had been so supportive,” noting that she and William understood the importance of sharing their son with the public. “But equally it was coupled with a newborn baby, and inexperienced parents, and the uncertainty of what that held, so there were all sorts of mixed emotions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WYS2MmqBgd2xSs8mDTZfpG-1920-80.jpg><p>Of George’s new birthday portrait, body language expert Judi James told<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1793813/prince-george-body-language-10th-birthday-photo referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>The Daily Express</u></a> that in the photo “George seems to have suddenly and emphatically stepped out of his childhood in this stunning birthday photo,” she said. “His cheeky grin has gone, as has his more playful, childlike body language, and instead we are seeing a young man looking relaxed and confident in a pose reminiscent of his father.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQhfdDbLkMDoNnsd6uRHTV-1920-80.jpg><p>James said his pose in the snap looks natural: “George displays an even eye gaze here and a symmetric, relaxed, natural-looking smile,” she said. “His pose on the steps might have been awkward but his long limbs make it look natural and authentic. He seems to be looking at the world in a calm and relaxed state and he looks very smart for his age here. There’s not an ounce of awkwardness as he poses for this portrait, just good humor and what looks like a desire to appear as unpretentious and as natural as possible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiqn66urb%2BOqamippOaeqixzquenmWkmru1tIyboKusmJmuunnPqKmtqpGewXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-william-wears-football-print-tie-euros.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William scores fashion goal with 185 accessory at Euro 2024 match - see photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patti-smith-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patti Smith Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
