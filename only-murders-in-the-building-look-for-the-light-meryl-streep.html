This comes while also maintaining the show's signature cozy vibe that makes it not only a delight to watch now, but one that will likely make for a comfort rewatch for fans for years and years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Now that the show is following one of theater director Oliver Putnam's (Martin Short) productions—and his desire to convert what was previously a doomed play into a musical—one of the show's biggest changes is just how large of a role original music is playing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Keep in mind, of course, that music has been key to the show in the past as well; the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0v6dmme1DU&ab_channel=Citiprime" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Serial- class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Serial-</a>esque <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youtu.be/I49mQBzQMDU data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="original music" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">original music</a> from composer Siddharta Khosla went a long way in drawing a connection to the true crime genre that the show satirizes, and featuring one of Charles Haden-Savage's (Steve Martin) original banjo songs from his TV star days (titled <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youtu.be/jYYqAXsz2Zs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Angel in Flip Flops"' class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">"Angel in Flip Flops"</a>) was a major highlight of Season 2.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But the best moment of Season 3 so far came at the end of "Grab Your Hankies," the third episode. It turns out that Oliver's desire to turn Death Rattle (a murder mystery where the prime suspects are infants) into a musical—which he plans to call Death Rattle Dazzle—has one major roadblock: he needs a show-stopping tune. And by the episode, he goes with his gut, allowing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a44786787/only-murders-in-the-building-meryl-streep-season-3/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep)" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep)</a> to take center stage with a grounded song, "Look for the Light," that blows everyone away.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In fact, Loretta's performance is so moving that Kimber (Joyride and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a43553665/beef-netflix-ending-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beef class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Beef</a> star Ashley Park) can't help but harmonize and sing along, eventually joining her on stage (something that does actually happen in these sorts of theater settings from time to time; more on that below).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Show-stopper: found.

Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who wrote the music for both La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen, were behind the music (and serve as consulting producers this season) for the scene, and specifically referenced <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youtu.be/PluaPvhkIMU data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hugh Jackman during a Greatest Showman showcase" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Hugh Jackman during a Greatest Showman showcase</a> as an example of unexpectedly joining someone in song.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Park, too, is doing her own singing in Only Murders in the Building. “Ashley Park’s glorious counter melody was added later,” singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, who co-wrote the music, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/only-murders-in-the-building-meryl-streep-look-for-the-light-released-1235567330/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "I got goosebumps the first time I heard it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">And the impact of that singing was felt by everyone you see in the room during the scene; after their scenes were shot, the LA Times article says, Streep and Park stuck around to continue performing the song live.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Everybody’s reactions were so genuine because they stood behind the cameras and sang every take live, with full expression and emotion,” Shankman said. “I know it’s a TV show and it’s all fiction, but that moment did not feel like fiction. It was a magical experience that I’ll never forget.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Clearly, the show knows that "Look for the Light" is a song that people are going to want to listen to over, and over, and over again—it's already streaming on Spotify.</p>This content is imported from Third party.
