And <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jenna Ortega</a> agrees: It might even be the best compliment you can get. "[A good scent is] so satisfying; when you catch a whiff of it every once in a while, it's so nice and so refreshing," the Wednesday actress and star of Dior's latest fragrance campaign tells InStyle over Zoom. "And the compliment 'You smell good' is the greatest.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scent is powerful. It can evoke strong emotions and tap into important memories. That's why Ortega picky about fragrance. Case in point: you'll never catch her at a candle store. "I can never walk into [that]," she explains. "It would throw me off." She prefers essential oils, which she's used for years, and credits her favorite smells with reducing anxiety and stress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most of all, she wants to feel like she's in a calm, clean space that smells like home. "My lifestyle is very chaotic. I'm kind of all over the place all the time. I don't really have a home base; I'm just kind of around. So I think to have something that [smells] calming or relieving just helps me feel a bit more grounded or at peace with everything that's going on," she says. "I think that's why I like something that's [clean] and sweet."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Mikael Jansson for Parfums Christian Dior&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ortega is one of seven actors and artists (the list includes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maya Hawke</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Thuso Mbedu</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Liu Yu Xin</a>) that Dior has tapped to star in its latest fragrance campaign, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Dare in Gris Dior</a>. In celebration of the brand's beloved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Gris Dior</a> scent, the message is simple: Embrace your most authentic self and push your creativity to be daring. Ortega says teaming up with the legendary perfume was a natural fit from the start, as she's always felt empowered to speak her voice and be herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alongside the campaign, the fashion house has also opened up a pop-up concept boutique in Los Angeles, California, to celebrate the iconic perfume. From April 11 to 16, visitors will be treated to a unique art gallery and scent experience (and naturally, a bit of shopping, too) to immerse themselves in the world of Gris Dior.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was kind of surprised when it came around because I thought, 'Oh, me? I don't know. Are you sure about that?' I didn't know if it was a mistake or something. It was such an honor and an incredible opportunity that I genuinely was blown away," says Ortega. "I'm so picky about my fragrance. Actually liking and being supportive of the product that you're endorsing is so nice. I just feel really lucky, more than anything."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Mikael Jansson for Parfums Christian Dior&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's no surprise that someone choosy like Ortega would be a fan of Gris Dior, the standout fragrance from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>La Collection Privee Christian Dior</a> set. It strikes that perfect balance of floral and wood with notes of jasmine and bergamot. The resulting scent is warm and earthy, with an added sweetness and a bit of spice. Never overpowering, the fragrance is remarkably light and clean, despite its complexity, and that's exactly why she loves it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love something that's a bit androgynous and can kind of go both ways, just as long as it smells clean and almost refreshing," she says. "I usually do a good spritz on my chest [and] neck area. I might get one of my wrists and rub it together, so [you can smell it] when you go in for a hug or something like that, but that's it. I don't do anymore or any less than that."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gris Dior is a scent that is made for everyone. But if she had to pick one of her characters who would be most drawn to its elusively cool scent, Ortega says there's no choice other than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Wednesday Addams</a>. "I don't know if it's because of the gray aspect that I'm saying that or because of the fact that there's an intense shade," she says. "[But] that's what she smells like."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yZ6lp5ldpL%2B1scaaZJ2hn6d6sbHRn6ymnV2eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9dbIFzf5Npbg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ali-hillis-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ali Hillis Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inanna-sarkis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Inanna Sarkis?
