Since 2018, the rapper’s remained behind bars related to drug trafficking charges. However, he hasn’t allowed his incarceration to slow down his musical output. The rapper returned to the fold this weekend with the official release of 97 Months. His new mixtape boasts 9 songs in total with several high-profile features. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jadakiss</a> appears on the previously released “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Street Honors,</a>” while Rowdy Rebel joins him on “Prison Everyday.” Additional features include rising Atlanta rapper Hunxho, Rotimi, and De’rez De’Shon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ralo announced the project’s release earlier this month along with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a photo of his daughter.</a> He said that he wasn’t able to touch his daughter in the past five years since his arrest but he explained that he found a new sense of purpose as a rapper. “I never called myself a rapper due to the lame shit that goes on in the industry, but I can now honesty say I'm thankful for the rap game, because it helped me take care of my daughter and more my entire bid,” he explained in the statement.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ralo-drops-97-months>Ralo Drops 97 Months</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper was formally sentenced to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">8 years in prison</a> in 2022 for his alleged role in the criminal conspiracy and drug trafficking case. However, he received credit for time served and still hopes that this chapter of his life will be put in the past sooner rather than later. “He was recommended 1 year ankle monitor after the halfway house approve his home address; which will bring him home to us late next year, but our goal is for him to complete his GED or RDAP Drug program so we can get another year off his sentence,” a post on his Instagram page.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ralo received significant support from the hip-hop community during his incarceration. While plenty of rappers have shouted him out on wax, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Baby</a>, for instance, gifted him $50K. Outside of Atlanta, Ralo earned support from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Killer Mike</a>, and more who signed an open letter to Joe Biden advocating for his release. We’re excited for Ralo to come home and return to his career.
