This means that they were born the same year. Tucker Carlson was born in 1969, making him 52 years old as of 2021. Therefore, Susan Andrews' age is also 52 years.</p><p class=align-left>She was born in the United States of America, so her nationality is American. She has Caucasian ethnicity.</p><h3>Susan Andrews' family</h3><p class=align-left>Susan is the daughter of Reverend George E. Andrews II. <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Her father served</a> as the headmaster of St. George's School, an elite Rhode Island boarding school, from 1984 to 1988. He was a tough man and disciplinarian, so it was not easy for Tucker to date his daughter.</p><p class=align-left>Not much is known about the Andrews' family. However, Reverend George once hit the headlines for not reporting a case of sexual abuse at St. George's School in the 1980s; a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teacher was accused</a> of s*xually assaulting a student.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/57a5beb08a976ffa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Susan Crow’s bio: All you need to know about Tony Bennett's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The reverend fired the choirmaster but failed to report the incident to the relevant authorities. He later claimed he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">did not report</a> the matter because he did not know the severity of the case and wished he had handled the case better. As a result, an independent investigation was ordered in 2016 by the Diocese of Southeast Florida.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3b1c0ab74d1fd379.jpg><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>Little is known about Susan's career path because she prefers to remain out of the public's prying eye. Presently, she is a full-time stay-at-home mother and wife.</p><p class=align-left>Reports indicate that before becoming a homemaker, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she worked at</a> an Episcopal school. She quit her job to take care of her family.</p><h3>Relationship with Tucker Carlson</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Tucker Carlson married to? Susan is the political commentator's wife. She and Carlson have what many would call a <a href=#>'dreamy relationship.' </a>They first met when they were in 10th grade, got attracted to each other, and<a href=#> started dating.</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/477c8f112cbae463.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jillian Fink's biography: what is known about Patrick Dempsey’s wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They were only 15 years old at the time. Tucker thought she was the most beautiful girl. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Susan was attracted by</a> his optimism, positivity, and the bounce in his walk.</p><p class=align-left>After high school, Tucker left for Trinity College, and the two had a long-distance relationship. Six months before graduating from college, Tucker <a href=#>asked Susan's father</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">permission to marry</a> her.</p><h4>Wedding</h4><p class=align-left>The lovebirds solemnized their union in 1991. The event was held in their high school chapel. The chapel was very special to them because it was where they first met. They have been married for the last three decades.</p><h4>How many children does Tucker Carlson have?</h4><p class=align-left>Tucker and Susan are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">blessed with four children</a>. They have three daughters and a son. The girls' names are Lillie, Dorothy, and Hopie, and the boy's name is Buckley.</p><p class=align-left>The ages of their children are yet to be disclosed to the public. However, it is known that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lillie is the oldest</a> and Buckley is the second-born.

At the time, a lady known as Kimberly Carter accused the <a href=#>political commentator </a>of s*xually assaulting her in a pizzeria in Kentucky.</p><p class=align-left>The alleged crime put Tucker's career and marriage on the line. Through it all, Susan stood by her husband. Carter would later apologize to the couple. She admitted that she had a mental illness that made her think that Tucker had s*xually assaulted her.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, Susan has helped her husband to become a better man. He has helped him <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">strengthen his faith</a>. When the show <i>Tucker</i> was cancelled, her husband almost got depression, but she remained by his side until he got back on his feet.</p><h3>Where does Susan Andrews live?</h3><p class=align-left>The Carlson family <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">resides in Washington, DC</a>. The family home was purchased in 2017 for $3.895 million.

In 2018, there was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an attempted break-in</a> in the Carlson home in Washington DC. At the time, Susan was the only one at home.
