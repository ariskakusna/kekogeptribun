Despite Kendrick Lamar departing the label in 2022, the lineup still consists of artists such as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>ScHoolboy Q</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ab-Soul</a>, Jay Rock, SZA, Isaiah Rashad, and many others. Unfortunately, the label has also garnered a reputation in the past few years for allegedly preventing their artists from releasing music for years at a time, prompting labels like Dreamville and Quality Control to put out a much larger and more compelling body of work. However, several posts from Top Dawg signees and label heads seem to hint that 2024 will be a massive year for the label, with several announced projects already in the works.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-an-alleged-leak-indicates-over-a-dozen-tde-releases-in-2024>An Alleged Leak Indicates Over A Dozen TDE Releases In 2024</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In late January, a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">leaked TDE release schedule</a> began circulating the internet, with many fans unsure of the document's validity. The document outlines a release order for over a dozen Top Dawg artists, all expected to land on streaming in 2024.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The fact that ScHoolboy Q will release <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his 6th studio album</a> next week suggests some validity behind the leak, as he occupies the first position on the list. If this leak proves true, listeners can anticipate a SiR album shortly after Q releases Blue Lips, closely followed by Jay Rock's next album. According to the leak, rapid subsequent album releases will follow by artists such as Doechii, Ray Vaughn, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Zacari</a>, before SZA finally drops the long-awaited SOS deluxe album, Lana. Then, fans could expect new music from Ab-Soul and Isaiah Rashad.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-will-tde-introduce-new-artists-in-2024>Will TDE Introduce New Artists In 2024?</h2></span><p>Top Dawg and Punch at the Billboard Power 100 Event held at NeueHouse Hollywood on January 31, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.

Most surprisingly, however, the image also suggests that the label will be dropping records from three unnamed artists, redacted in the style of a classified government form. If all goes according to plan for TDE, this would reinvigorate the label as one of the best homes for high-quality hip hop known to the music industry, rivaling historic successes from the likes of Death Row and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Unit</a> Records.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jay-rock-tde-compilation-dropping-this-year-too>Jay Rock: TDE Compilation Dropping This Year, Too</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite Kendrick's departure from the label, Jay Rock has confirmed that a compilation project celebrating 20 years of Top Dawg Entertainment is set to release in 2024, featuring "a majority of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Black Hippy</a> on that thang." It's still unclear if the album will be composed of previously released music in the vein of a greatest hits LP, or if the project will have numerous brand new songs on it. However, Jay Rock has specified that he and his label-mates have been hard at work on the compilation, with the album release planned for the first quarter of 2024.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For now, we'll still have to wait and see what TDE has planned in 2024. The only album 100 percent confirmed with a release date is ScHoolboy Q's Blue Lips, though many other projects are currently in the works at the prolific label. If Top Dawg Entertainment releases even a fraction of the albums they've promised for 2024, this year will certainly go down in history as the label's greatest achievement.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>TeeJay Small is a professional humorist, pop culture columnist, and an avid enjoyer of all things hip hop.
