offer...</span><span>),</span><span> here's the lowdown on getting a court-ordered DNA test in Georgia:</span></p><li data-sourcepos=19:1-19:151><strong>File a Petition:</strong><span> Head to your local Superior Court and file a petition to establish paternity.</span><span> This document officially kicks off the process.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=20:1-20:125><strong>Serve the Other Party:</strong><span> Once the petition is filed,</span><span> you need to legally notify the other person involved (alleged dad,</span><span> presumed mom,</span><span> etc.</span><span>) about the court date.</span><span> Think fancy envelope,</span><span> not a Facebook message.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=21:1-21:233><strong>Hear the Judge Roar:</strong><span> The judge will review the petition and hear arguments from both sides.</span><span> Fun fact:</span><span> sometimes Maury reruns are used as evidence.</span><span> (Okay,</span><span> maybe not,</span><span> but a lawyer can tell you what will actually be considered).</span></li><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:200><strong>Swab City:</strong><span> If the judge orders a DNA test,</span><span> you'll both get a date to visit a

data-sourcepos=33:1-33:48><strong>How much does a court-ordered DNA test cost?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=35:1-35:145><span>It depends.</span><span> Sometimes the court covers the
