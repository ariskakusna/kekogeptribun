The good news is that the State of New Jersey does not have a mandatory waiting period for marriages that have lasted longer than six months. Also, NJ promotes collaborative divorce law featuring alternative dispute resolution, ADR. This allows both parties to seek an amicable solution regarding custody, finances, and property thus, potentially avoiding complications that can create for a time consuming and messy divorce proceeding. However, when dealing with a marriage and business relationship lasting over 20 years, the process of equitable distribution of assets can pose a challenge. Both parties may have their own independent idea of who was the primary contributor to amassing these assets. With each being successful in their respective careers, the division of assets will most likely be time-consuming and could become contentious.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>When do you expect the divorce to be finalized?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I will say this - if they are smart they will get in a room with their respective attorneys and say, “let’s get this done together,” which means they will negotiate their division of assets in a civil way so they don’t have to go to court. The proceedings could take a very long time with all of their property. If this is a marriage that can't be saved and Wendy doesn't want to save it at this point - the quickest course of action is to negotiate together respectfully. If they have good attorneys, they will tell them to get this done amongst themselves, but this could take years if it makes its way to court.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Will there be custody issues regarding their 19-year-old son, Kevin Jr.?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kevin Jr. is over the age of 18 so the court will not need to consider a custody arrangement or child support. However, Kevin Jr., still may have dependent expenses as any young adult has such as; healthcare, college education, car insurance, housing, and general living maintenance which would likely need to be negotiated in this divorce process.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What assets are at stake in the divorce? We reported that Kevin Hunter&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">bought his mistress a new Ferrari</a> the other day. Are she and Kevin entitled to keep gifts and property transferred during the marriage?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is where the process becomes fascinating, and not knowing all the facts, we should look to the big picture. In the absence of specific details, &nbsp; assets acquired during the marriage are part of an equitable distribution process in NJ. The State of NJ does not always guarantee a 50/50 split. These co-mingled assets and funds will need to be divided and both parties are required to submit proof of how they were purchased or earned. For example, any gifts purchased and given to Kevin’s mistress will need to be traced to the bank account/funds used to pay for them. Ownership and title with respect to all marital assets will be relevant information. If Kevin and Wendy co-mingled their funds, things can get very messy. Since they both are stakeholders in their successful production company, it will be quite interesting to see how this plays out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">No. The new baby allegedly born to Kevin and his mistress is not Wendy’s biological child. She has no responsibilities for child care or support. If Kevin is not listed on the birth certificate as father and there is no executed acknowledgment of paternity, he will have no legal responsibility to support the child until paternity is established. If and when it is established, he would be responsible for child care costs and expenses from the time of birth.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Alleged instances of Kevin’s&nbsp;physical abuse and&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Wendy’s addiction</a> will come up in the divorce proceedings. Hopefully, they can find a way to settle so this isn’t necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bobby Bank/WireImage/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>What kind of money will Kevin Hunter walk away with at the end of the divorce?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">I don't know their exact net worth but I will say that he will definitely walk away with a significant sum of money, especially because most success they have received has been together. Wendy accumulated into a huge success and he has been a big part of that as he is her manager and the Executive Producer on her talk show. This gives him a pretty big level of equity in her success.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>With Kevin being her manager, how could that affect the legal proceedings, if at all? As well as the fact that they jointly own her company, Wendy Williams Production? How would the division of that work?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Wendy and Kevin more than likely have their ownership percentages in the production company established. This is where the equitable distribution of assets comes into play. With the company being classified as a marital asset, the court will consider a host of factors in determining the distribution percentages. Again, negotiating a fair settlement through ADR where both parties win can avoid and resolve all of this potential drama with the court interceding.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is correct and I hope this dirty laundry would not become tabloid news. Any funds used during the affair that are from their business and joint accounts would be considered part of the division of assets. I can’t stress enough the importance of negotiating an agreement that avoids all these details and prevents the divorce process from dragging out longer than necessary. In the end, lawyers are the only winners of long drawn out divorces.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZYR1gJFmrp6mlK56uLXLpaCapaNisarCzquanmWclsKzsc1mo5qjlWLAsbHApKpmp55itbDDjKagrKyimsC0ecaina2rXZaxpbXCraCopl2Wu6V5zKipnmWnnrmtec%2BlmLJlkWK%2FsLjEZqWer6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-episode-of-true-blood-do-eric-and-sookie-make-love-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What episode of True Blood do Eric and Sookie make love?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./need-closet-update-were-giving-away-shopping-spree-and-trip-new-york-city.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>We're Giving Away a Shopping Spree and Trip to NYC!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
