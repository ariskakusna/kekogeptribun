This particularly nasty rumor started circulating after Costner’s wife of 18 years, Christine, unexpectedly filed for <a href=#>divorce</a> on Monday.</p><p>Sources close to Kevin Costner told TMZ that the rumor was “total BS,” which, yeah, this does seem pretty far-fetched. There have been rumors about <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Yellowstone data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Yellowstone</a> drama for a while, but this one is a little out of left field. Reportedly, the conflicts were mostly due to scheduling issues and Costner focusing on his expansive Western film <a href=#>Horizon</a>.</p><p>Even the rumors about scheduling conflicts have been shot down by Kevin Costner and his reps, so the pregnancy rumors must sound especially ridiculous to his team. Whether or not Kevin Costner returns to Yellowstone for another season, it’s likely that the reasons will be pretty straightforward. With that being said, now that Costner is dealing with a divorce, it does seem even less likely that he would come back for another season of the popular Paramount series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kevin-costner-yellowstone-cowboy-hat-900x506.jpg><p>Even if Kevin Costner decides not to return for more Yellowstone, we’ll at least get to see him in the role when the second half of Season 5 returns later this year. There’s no official release date for the second half yet, but it’s expected to come out in the summer. After the big cliffhanger in the mid-season finale, fans are certainly waiting on pins and needles for the show to return.</p><p>With it seeming more and more likely that Kevin Costner will leave, it seems like we might actually be saying goodbye to the flagship Yellowstone series for good after the season finale. Not only is there no production planned for a sixth season, but the Writer’s Guild of America just began a strike. With there being no announcement of a date for the WGA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers&nbsp;to restart negotiations, it’s entirely possible this strike could go on for months.</p><p>With Kevin Costner out and no one even working on the script for a sixth season of Yellowstone, fans might just have to settle for the stable of spin-offs the franchise has planned. Fortunately, there are quite a few of these on the table. The <a href=#>Harrison Ford</a> and Helen Mirren-led 1923 will return for a second season, and now there’s a new spin-off planned with Matthew McConaughey in the lead.</p><p>Additionally, there is the <a href=#>Bass Reeves</a> spin-off that will star David Oyelowo&nbsp;as the titular lawman and the 6666 spin-off about the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas. While Kevin Costner will certainly be missed as the patriarchal John Dutton in the Yellowstone universe, Taylor Sheridan’s expansive franchise should keep fans occupied for years to come. You can stream the flagship series on Peacock, and its spin-offs on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ijlau2r3nCqKqtppWnerqxy6WmsKukpLumecyepJudomK9s7HGp5inrF6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./king-charles-frustrated-letting-people-down-exclusive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>King Charles will be feeling 'frustrated' that he's 'letting people down' amid cancer treatment</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1122580-jamb-cut-mark-polytechnic-2017-18-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JAMB cut off mark for Polytechnic 2017-18</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
