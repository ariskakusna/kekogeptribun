It also says that Witness women cannot teach unless no men are available, and when they do they must wear head coverings to show “submission to the headship arrangement.”<h2>Why do Jehovah Witness not celebrate birthdays?</h2>Practicing Jehovah's Witnesses "do not celebrate birthdays because we believe that such celebrations displease God" Even though "the Bible does not explicitly forbid celebrating birthdays," the reasoning lies in biblical ideas, according to an FAQ on the Jehovah's Witnesses' official website.<h2>How much money do Jehovah's Witnesses have to give?</h2>Funding.
