his actions were taken in a single-minded effort to wake up from that dream and return home to his family.”</p><p>The lawyers added they were “disappointed” their client was still indicted on 83 counts of recklessly endangering another person.</p><p>“Captain Emerson had no criminal intent, and we look forward to being able to present a fulsome defense at trial and bring forth all the facts and circumstances to a jury. Captain Emerson’s defense team is crafting a release plan and expect that he will finally return home to his family by the end of this week.”</p><p>Emerson pleaded not guilty. He is being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center, according to Schmidt, and is scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop><p>Speaking to <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>The New York Times</a> from prison last month, Emerson explained that he had taken psychedelic mushrooms for the first time two days before the incident during a weekend trip in which he gathered with friends to commemorate the death of his own best friend.</p><p>At the time, the flight was en route to San Francisco from Everett, Washington, but was forced to divert to Portland, Oregon, as Emerson experienced his mid-flight meltdown.</p><p>The off-duty pilot, who was seated in the cockpit jump seat when he tried to shut off the engines, said he was still in a hallucinogenic state as the plane took off, adding he had not dealt with longstanding mental health issues.</p><p>The Times noted the difficulty for pilots struggling with such issues, facing potential grounding by their airline if they seek psychiatric help. In an email to the Times, Alaska Airlines, who Emerson works for as a pilot, said that “more can be done” to support pilot mental health.</p><p>Emerson claimed he texted a friend while on the flight saying he was having a “panic attack,” and that he thought he was dead or dreaming. He yelled at the pilots for help, but said he was convinced that if he shut the engines of the plane off, he would wake up.</p><p>After a struggle with the pilots of the plane, Emerson was taken into custody, where he recalled stripping naked, trying to jump out a window, urinating on himself, and even attempting to ejaculate in an attempt to wake up as he was being interviewed by cops and held in a cell at the airport.</p><p>It took him five days to finally sober up, he claimed. “I am horrified that those actions put myself at risk and others at risk.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfpLOnecOuq7JlkaGutLfAZpiiqpyeu6a%2FjKmgpaekYsSpu4ytqaKdlGLBsHnSoaytZZ%2Bbs26xzaCgp52jYrqqsIyfo6KfmKl6pr%2FCmqeeq12WwbWxzKmrnpxdosKzsMSrZJygkae0pr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oprah-winfrey-michael-bay-highest-paid-celebrities-forbes-365703.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oprah Winfreys Annual Earnings Drop by $125 Million, Says Forbes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nessa-diab-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nessa Diab Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
