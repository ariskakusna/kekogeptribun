Ignore anything anyone’s saying; there’s no nudity,’ ” she explained. “And then I thought, ‘The movie’s going to come out and they’re going to see that there’s nudity,’ so I changed that to ‘It’s actually a body double and they just CGI’d my head onto someone else.’ And my family doesn’t have anything to do with the entertainment industry … and they were like, ‘They can do that? And I was like, ‘Oh, technology these days. You wouldn’t believe what they do in Hollywood!’</p><p>“And then eventually I came clean: ‘I’m doing nudity, but you should read the book first, and if you still want to see the movie after reading the book …’ ”</p><p>The actress also revealed how in her first meeting with her Management 360 rep, she told him how she won a competitive eating contest in Australia by consuming four pounds of spaghetti bolognese and ended up projectile vomiting, much to the horror of her Australian agent.
