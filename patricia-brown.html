Jeff remained popular among youngsters during the ‚Äô80s, 90‚Äôs era for his music based on jazz fusion, hard rock, blues rock, and electronica.</p><p>Jeff was counted as one of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.

But no one ever has come to know about her actual date and age. We believe that she would be a native of England as her husband was also born in Wallington, Surrey, England.</p><p>Spending her life in England Patricia would remain a great student at her local school and university college where she earlier went to have her educational certificates. As of 2023, no one has seen Patricia anywhere since she separated from Jeff in 1967.
