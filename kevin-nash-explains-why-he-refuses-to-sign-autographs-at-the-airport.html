He has competed for several years and has played a role in many iconic moments. That being said, Nash has a strict policy of not signing autographs at the airport.</p><p>The issue of fans showing up at airports to meet pro wrestlers has become a recurring problem for several stars. While chance encounters are usually welcomed, a particular group of people now deliberately plan to be at the airport with a ton of merchandise, hoping to get the stars to sign them. These items are then later sold on eBay for a profit, causing frustration for the wrestlers.</p><p>Earlier this year, a video of an unmasked Rey Mysterio found its way to social media. In the clip, Rey is seen rejecting a fan’s request for&nbsp;<a href=#>autograph at an airport</a>. Of course, this fan was obviously trying to sell Mysterio’s autograph for a profit.</p><p>While speaking with co-host Sean Oliver on&nbsp;<a href=#>Kliq This</a>, Kevin Nash was asked his views about fans swarming wrestlers at the airport for autographs. Nash made it clear he would never sign autographs for adults and explained the reason behind it.</p><p>“I won’t do it for an adult. I know how much those things go for. It used to be you could sign your name on then with a paint pen, [but] they got shit that they can just wipe that right off it. To me, it’s like if you’re carrying a Funko, I ain’t signing it. So don’t carry a Funko.</p><p>Yeah, you’ll see a price listing in of it. The only reason I’m at the airport is because I’m going to a signing. So your chances of getting something for free, being the reason that I’m leaving my f***** house in the first place, is about as good a chance of f***** Punk being the main event on Raw Monday when he showed up in the parking lot.”</p><p>Wrestlers are not obliged to entertain fan requests, and it entirely depends on the wrestler in question whether they want to sign anything. Regardless, there will always be a section of fans who feel entitled to get autographs and that’s unlikely to ever change.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What is your opinion on what Kevin Nash said?
