Kath had a lot of artistic genes transferred to her parents.&nbsp;His father William H. Moennig III makes the violin, a trade that may have a connection with his own father, William Moennig, who grew up in Markneukirchen, a small German town renowned for its musical instruments.&nbsp;Moreover, he is an amazing artist who can paint, draw and sculpt anything he sees.&nbsp;Mary Zahn, Kath’s mother, was a ballerina.</span></p><p><span>Did you know that Katherine Moennig is the first cousin of actors Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Paltrow?&nbsp;Her father is the maternal half-sister of the famous actress Blythe Danner, mother of Gwyneth Paltrow.&nbsp;That makes Blythe and her brother Harry Danner, who are also Moennig’s half-aunts and uncles respectively.</span></p><p><span>Growing up on the 12th floor of an apartment building in Philly, Moening who became a tomboy from an early age would spend most of her time hanging out with her male neighbors.&nbsp;Her first interest in acting was sparked at the age of 10, when her best friend was motivating her to act in a children’s theater.&nbsp;However, Moennig wasn’t quite sure acting was what she wanted to do in the long term and much later in life.</span></p><p><span>For a long time in his teens, Moennig was unfocused.&nbsp;She didn’t seem very interested in academics and often sneaked out to hang out with friends who weren’t even her classmates.&nbsp;From time to time, she traveled to New York with these friends to attend parties.&nbsp;At some point in her life, she thought she would eventually become a doorman.</span></p><p><span>However, after high school, Moennig seemed to have decided what to do: pursue an acting career.&nbsp;It was her way of getting away from Philly where she didn’t want to be tempted to work in her father’s violin business.&nbsp;Her interest began to grow when she enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.&nbsp;She was 18 at the time.</span></p><p><span>Luckily for Moennig, her parents who had always understood her lack of interest in academics were supportive.&nbsp;Like most aspiring actors, Kath started out doing commercials, one of which was for the defunct Fleet Bank.</span></p><p><span>It wasn’t long before Kath found herself in Hollywood.&nbsp;She greatly impressed in her first film role which came in the drama series&nbsp;</span><span>Young Americans</span><span>.&nbsp;Moennig has never looked back since.&nbsp;Some of his early films would include&nbsp;</span><span>Like It Tough</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Shipping News</span></p><p><span>Kath’s role as Shane McCutcheon in the lesbian series&nbsp;</span><span>The World</span><span>&nbsp;has become a big break in her career opening the door to more gigs that will soon follow.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she gay/lesbian, engaged or married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>It’s no secret that Katherine Moening is openly gay/lesbian.&nbsp;She has portrayed a lesbian/queer/trans persona in a handful of movies and TV shows.&nbsp;Kath is quite secretive when it comes to her romantic life.&nbsp;However, over the years, she has been linked to a number of women.</span></p><p><span>Among them, Holly Miranda, Amanda Moore and Evan Rachel Wood.&nbsp;The latter, although short-lived, generated a lot of media interest.&nbsp;Reporters saw them (pictured) on a date outside a restaurant in West Hollywood, California in October 2014. Wood had come out as bisexual three years ago in 2012.</span></p><p><span>Moennig’s relationship with Woods reportedly ended in November of that year.&nbsp;However, the two remain close friends.&nbsp;Based on the facts we have gathered, Katherine Moennig is likely single at the time of writing this article and not engaged or married.&nbsp;Meanwhile, it seems her dogs and cats are making sure her celibacy isn’t boring.&nbsp;Her Instagram feed says it all.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpJitoJWntq%2BxjKamnqaenrRutdJmqqGdXZyuunnLnqqboZGjeqa6xpqenpxdpL9uucCrqaKdlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-talena-atfield-dating-now-a-look-at-her-relationship-status-and-dating-life-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Talena Atfield Dating Now?: A Look at Her Relationship Status and Dating Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-vitamins-should-i-take-for-warts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What vitamins should I take for warts?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
