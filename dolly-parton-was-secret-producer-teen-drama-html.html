Whether it’s about her generosity or that she was secretly involved in backing something that we all love, these facts always seem to shock everyone. The latter rumor has now been proven true, as Sarah Michelle Gellar <a href=#>confirmed </a>that Dolly Parton was a producer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. According to Gellar in the below <a href=#>video</a>, “Little known fact, the legend Dolly was a producer.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Gellar is doing her rounds on the talk show circuit to promote her <a href=#>return to acting</a>, as she is set to star in Wolf Pack, which is a sort of spiritual successor to MTV’s Teen Wolf series. While on The Tonight Show, the former Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor revealed that long-standing rumor that Dolly Parton was indeed a producer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also stated that Parton would send the cast gifts during Christmas, and even praised Gellar on her performance, a fact that made Gellar quite happy.</p><p>Dolly Parton clearly had some good taste and a keen eye for success, as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is arguably the best teen drama that has ever been made. The series was based on the movie of the same name and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar, Nichols Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, <a href=#>David Boreanaz</a>, Seth Green, James Marsters, and so many more. The show would birth spinoffs like Angel, which led to the “Buffyverse.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-sarah-michelle-gellar-joss-whedon-900x506.jpg><p>Dolly Parton being a <a href=#>producer </a>for Buffy the Vampire Slayer just adds to the list of features and shows that the singer has been involved with her Sandollar Productions company. In the 1990s, Parton’s production company handled the Father of the Bride movies, Straight Talk, and Sabrina. Though it has long been rumored that Parton was involved with Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar has finally confirmed it, which is sure to delight fans.</p><p>We are not sure if this opens the door for Dolly Parton to produce or attempt to produce a Buffy the Vampire reunion of sorts, but we would certainly be happy if Ms. Parton were to take charge in making that a reality. Entertainment Weekly did have a sit down with the cast for its 20-year anniversary, but we would love to see them all return for a special much like the Harry Potter one that HBO Max put together last year. At least we can all be happy to know that Parton was one of the reasons that Buffy existed in the first place.</p><p>For now, everyone can see Sarah Michelle Gellar in the new supernatural series, <a href=#>Wolf Pack</a>, which is currently streaming its first episode on Paramount+. The second episode has also dropped on the streamer, with each corresponding episode releasing on Thursdays. We have not yet seen the series, but we would love to hear that Dolly Parton backed Gellar in this series in the same way that she had when Buffy the Vampire Slayer was released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2icn6G5unnPmqmtp55ixKK%2FjKycnKqVqXqxvs6drJydomLBprHNZpurmZ2We6nAzKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dominik-mysterio-shows-off-prison-workout-that-made-him-a-hard-man.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dominik Mysterio Shows Off Prison Workout That Made Him A Hard Man</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./news-does-will-barton-wife-looking-rumors-around-partner-viral-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Will Barton have a wife?
