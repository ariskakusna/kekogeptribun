The song's characters, their relationship and the emotions they embody, appear to be derived from a variety of sources, including Swift's personal life, literary references, and potentially, wider pop culture narratives.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>To explore the possible personal influences, while respecting Swift's privacy, it's worth noting that Swift has often woven elements of her real-life experiences into her music. "Cardigan" contains a maturity and a sense of introspection that could reflect Swift's own growth as an artist and a person. Given the song's nostalgic tone, it might well be drawing from her past relationships and the lessons learned from them. The lyric "Chase two girls, lose the one" might potentially allude to a real-life situation where Swift felt sidelined in a relationship.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The character described in the song also harks back to the archetype of the 'Lost Boy,' as suggested in the line "Peter losing Wendy." The Peter Pan story is a well-established narrative about refusing to grow up and the fear of commitment. The female protagonist, or 'Wendy,' therefore, can be seen as someone left behind by an emotionally unavailable 'Peter.' The use of such literary references not only adds a layer of complexity to the song but also cements Swift's standing as a master storyteller.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Pop culture's influence on "Cardigan" can be seen in the song's narrative arc, which bears resemblance to some of the iconic 'will-they-won't-they' love stories that abound in films and TV series. The narrative trope of lovers separated by circumstance, only to be reunited later, is a common one in the pop culture sphere, seen in everything from classics like "Casablanca" to more contemporary series like "Friends."</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Historically, the song’s central image of an 'old cardigan' echoes the long tradition of using clothing as a symbol in literature and poetry. From Othello's handkerchief to the glass slipper in Cinderella, clothing has been used to represent love, status, identity, and transformation. Swift uses the cardigan to symbolize a sense of comfort, familiarity, and the undervalued aspects of love. The protagonist feels like an 'old cardigan' - overlooked until the other person realizes her worth and calls her their 'favorite.' This feeling of being undervalued and then cherished can resonate with many listeners, making the characters more relatable.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Additionally, Swift’s songwriting often incorporates elements from American folklore and pastoral imagery, reflecting her love for the American literary tradition. References like "steppin' on the last train," "downtown bars," and "your heartbeat on the High Line" contribute to the sense of nostalgia and create a rich, uniquely American setting.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>In conclusion, the characters of "Cardigan" seem to emerge from a rich tapestry of influences. While they may be informed by Swift's personal experiences and relationships, they also embody universal themes, resonate with literary and historical references, and align with recurring narratives in popular culture. The magic of Swift's songwriting lies in how she weaves these diverse threads into a compelling narrative that speaks to the listener's heart, making her music universally relatable and enduringly popular.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufony1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMpbCroZOofLi0zmagrGWklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbq%2FAq5uin5GjeqKuzq6r</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1583311-who-sheila-marie-ryan-what-happened-james-caans-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who was Sheila Marie Ryan?
