Thank you!” one person said.</p><p>“Omg I absolutely LOVE this costume idea,” another wrote.</p><p>One said: “Apparently some people don’t understand a freaking joke So many keyboard warriors. Do y’all wear capes while you are ferociously searching social media for something that offends you?”</p><p>Not everyone thought the outfit was something to be laughed at, with many accusing Ms Dayss of making fun of dead children.</p><p>“This is disgusting and vile. Way to go putting your complete lack of class on display for the world. Your mama must be so proud,” one person said.</p><p>“So many children have DIED from vaccines, so this is why it hurts people. Comments like this are classless and disgusting. Mocking dead children in any scenario is appalling,” another said.</p><p>Other people slammed her as “inhumane” and “heartless”.</p><p>Another woman chose to go a step further and fire back at Ms Dayss costume with her own Halloween outfit.</p><p>Heather Simpson posted a photo of herself covered in red dots with the caption: “Was trying to think of the least scary thing I could be for Halloween … so I became the measles.”</p><p>But her costume didn’t quite go over as she had planned, with many accusing her of making fun of people who have died from measles.</p><p>Despite people pointing out that many people have died of measles, Ms Simpson defended her anti-vax stance by saying “step and the common cold” have also killed people.</p><p>One medical professional commented on the post offering to let her see first hand what the measles does to people.</p><p>“You can tell our measles encephalitis and viral sepsis patients, the ones in comas and seizures and high fevers, that their suffering isn’t all that bad and is just being exaggerated by ‘Big Pharma’,” they wrote.</p><p>“You can even assist with the spinal tap! Read your favourite vaccine insert to them while they sob in fear and agony. Very cool and very fun!”</p><p>They finished off by saying Ms Simpson was a “horrible person” and “possibly a sociopath”.</p><p>There were a few commenters who defended her costume, claiming it wasn’t any more offensive than the one worn by Ms Dayss.</p><p>Two days after making the Facebook post, Ms Simpson apologised for her costume, saying it wasn’t “Christ like”.</p><p>“It wasn’t meant to be a jab at babies who have died from the measles. Literally at all. Every single baby’s life matters. So the post really did not reflect my heart,” she said.</p><p>“What I’m NOT sorry for, is that I don’t fear the measles.</p><p>“My post, as rude as it may have been, is a call to re-examine what we live in fear of. Our fear of the measles has caused us to literally beg the government to take away our bodily autonomy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z71qikmqajYq6vwMivmLGwlad6qa3LpaawnZWjeqS70q2spp1dqL2ivsqsZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qyZ56axLR50q2mq7Ffl7NzgZVxbJpwlW2Ao4LFa25sb5aWgaetw2ppm2piZ4E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-of-us-are-dead-cast-netflix.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'All of Us Are Dead' Cast | Actors &amp;amp; Characters in 'All of Us Are Dead'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wolf-wall-streets-margot-robbie-669227.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wolf of Wall Streets Margot Robbie on Nailing Her Brooklyn Accent, Lying About Movies Nu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
