The two had also been spotted separately before news of the divorce broke not wearing their wedding rings.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Despite the reportedly contentious dynamic between the two at the time Asghari filed for divorce, he tells People that he’ll “never” speak badly about Spears.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’ve always hated people leaving a certain relationship — and at some point they told each other they love each other and they sat at the same table and ate food [together] — so I never understood when people part ways [and] they talk badly about each other,” he says now. “That’s something I’m never going to do because I had nothing but an amazing experience and a great life, and that’s always going to be part of my life, a chapter of my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking more generally as he looks back ahead of his birthday, Asghari adds, “I always have the most positive mindset about life. My experiences in life have shaped me into the man I am today. I will continue growing. I come from a place where we celebrate our past,” he says. “I look back fondly. My past was a blessing and beautiful.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the time of his and Spears’ split, Asghari shared a statement on his Instagram stories in which he indicated he had no ill will towards his ex-wife. “After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together,” he wrote. “We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. Shit happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-speaks-out-divorce-husband-sam-asghari-1235570469/>Spears took to her own Instagram account</a> the next day to address the split. She wrote, “6 years is a long time to be with someone so, I’m a little shocked but…I’m not here to explain why because its honestly nobody’s business !!! But, I couldn’t take the pain anymore honestly!!! In some sort of telepathic way I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you!!!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She continued, “I’ve been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it’s far from reality and I think we all know that!!! I would love to show my emotions and tears on how I really feel but some reason I’ve always had to hide my weaknesses!!! If I wasn’t my dad’s strong soldier, I would be sent away to places to get fixed by doctors!!! But that’s when I needed family the most!!! You’re supposed to be loved unconditionally…not under conditions!!!! So I will be as strong as I can and do my best!!! And I’m actually doing pretty damn good!!! Anyways have a good day and don’t forget to smile!!!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spears released a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-abortion-1235620535/>headline</a>–<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-memoir-diane-sawyer-interview-justin-timberlake-breakup-1235623214/>making</a> <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-memoir-father-jamie-called-fat-1235620387/>memoir</a>, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-chicago-movie-memoir-1235625638/>The Woman in Me</a>, last fall after her high-profile conservatorship ended following a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/britney-spears-conservatorship-ends-1235045703/>Los Angeles judge’s ruling in November 2021</a> to terminate the arrangement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnSmqRmmaOctaK%2ByGarmqSbqHqltdWoqZydXaWysLzLnmSmp6aaerC6jGppbG1oaX5zhJBo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carmine-appice-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carmine Appice Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-banks-open-or-closed-on-black-friday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are banks open or closed on Black Friday?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
