"There was something about her, something that breathed through the tough outer body—an air, a scent, a whisper—the unmistakable essence of one whom love has struck on the heart. Occasionally, in an old barn, you become aware, though the scent has long been vanished, that once there were apples in the loft. Aunt Sass was like that."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Among Morehead's more whimsical qualities were her pack of small dogs, all of which were named Tinker or Badger ("inheriting the names as though they were titles," Travers says in Aunt Sass). And much like Poppins, she could make up rhymes and songs on the spot to control, discipline, or reward her charges, like:</p>I looked through the window and what did I see? A bad little boy who wouldn't take his Tea.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And:</p>I said, 'I will spank him and send him to bed!' But I gave him a large Chocolate Drop instead.<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The terror and delight of Morehead's manner "infected all children and they adored her as something more than human," Travers writes in Aunt Sass. She was like the "central shaft of a merry-go round" and a "born ancestress and matriarch."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's unclear how much of Travers's description of Morehead is real, since she "merged truth and fiction," Aunt Sass editor Donna Coonan <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/23/mary-poppins-real-life-model-unseen-rl-travers-story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Guardian in 2014" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told The Guardian in 2014</a>.

By the end of the second World War, nannies had all but disappeared.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike the Banks family in Disney's film adaption, the middle-class Banks family in Travers's books struggles financially and lives in "the smallest house in the Lane,” which is “rather dilapidated and needs a coat of paint," according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/19/becoming-mary-poppins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New Yorker" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New Yorker</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It never occurred to Travers, as she began writing the first book, that anyone would want to publish it. "I wrote it for myself," she told the BBC. "My friend said 'I'll take this to a publisher.' I thought 'Well a publisher won't want this!' But, apparently he did."</p><img alt="Julie Andrews,&nbsp;Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber, and Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins." title="Julie Andrews, Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber, and Dick Van Dyke" width=594 height=408 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-british-actress-julie-andrews-the-pseudonym-of-julia-news-photo-174304947-1539626896.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Mondadori Portfolio</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, with Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber, and Dick Van Dyke.</p><img alt="Julie Andrews, Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber, and Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins." title="Julie Andrews, Karen Dotrice, Matthew Garber, and Dick Van Dyke." width=2285 height=1828 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dick-van-dyke-as-bert-julie-andrews-as-mary-poppins-karen-news-photo-57643988-1539626846.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Silver Screen Collection</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The book was released in 1934. It caught the attention of Diane Disney, Walt Disney’s daughter, who introduced it to her father.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For 20 years, Travers refused to sell to Disney, for fear they "would sentimentalise her chilly, dark tales of Edwardian nursery life," according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/24/pl-travers-mary-poppins-documentary data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>. When Travers did eventually sign a deal, she was given a cut of the gross earnings and script approval.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>During the premiere, she cried, not tears of joy, but out of anger. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the picture's premiere, she cried, not tears of joy, but out of anger. The film, she thought, had "done a strange kind of violence to her work," according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/19/becoming-mary-poppins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New Yorker" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New Yorker</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Travers felt Disney changed her beloved Poppins for the worse. Like, for example, that iconic and emotional moment in the film when Andrews sings of paying a vagrant woman to feed the birds in front of St. Paul's Cathedral. In the book, Travers set the scene a bit differently: Poppins had "little time for the Bird Woman and... on the issue of avian welfare in the capital went further to suggest they should be baked in a pie, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/film/commentisfree/2015/sep/15/mary-poppins-disney-film-remake-pl-travers-book data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I approved of Julie Andrews. I've seen it once or twice and I've learned to live with it, it's glamorous and it's a good film on its own level," Travers told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p009mzp2 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=BBC class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BBC</a>. "But, I don't think it's very like my books."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Travers was much more willing to sell the Mary Poppins theatrical rights. In the early 1990s, she made a deal with Cameron Mackintosh, who produced Cats, Les Miserables, The Phantom of the Opera, and Miss Saigon. “She liked him very much,” Diana Rawstron, a lawyer in London and trustee of Ms. Travers’s estate, told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/theater/05weis.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a> in 2006. “She felt that he would be true to her original work.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Broadway show ran for more than six years, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTrb1uoCkjw" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="with Ashley Brown as Poppins" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">with Ashley Brown as Poppins</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the release of Mary Poppins Returns approaches, we can’t help but wonder what she’d think of the story plot for the sequel, which will follow the now grownup Banks kids who have children of their own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly before her death, Travers said she no longer cared to overanalyze fairy tales like Mary Poppins, as it takes away from the story. "The first thing you must do with a fairy tale is to love it and to keep it inside yourself..." she said. "To analyze it seems to me profanity."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a954944a-a788-480d-84d4-4e05cc402f84_1524070276.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rose Minutaglio" title="Headshot of Rose Minutaglio" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rose is a Senior Editor at ELLE overseeing features and projects about women's issues.
