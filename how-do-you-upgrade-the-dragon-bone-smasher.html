Used with two hands and fully upgraded, you'll get an attack rating north of 400, especially if you have a high enough strength stat. Even better, you can still enchant the Dragon Bone Smasher even further to make it deal even more damage.<h2>Is the Dragon Bone Smasher a good weapon?</h2>Demon's Souls' Dragon Bone Smasher is one of the best Strength weapons in the game, but to get it players will need to understand World Tendency. Getting a powerful weapon can make all the difference in Demon's Souls, and few are as powerful as the Dragon Bone Smasher.<h2>Can you upgrade the Dragon Bone Crusher?</h2>Dragon Bone Smasher can be upgraded up to +5 at Blacksmith Ed using Colorless Demon Souls.<h2>Can Dragon Bone Smasher be parried?</h2>Players will need to have a weapon that allows them to parry in order to perform the maneuver, and they'll only be able to parry against certain kinds of attacks. Acid, Poison, Death Cloud spells, and the Dragon God's fire breath are not attacks a player can parry.<h2>Demon's Souls WHERE TO UPGRADE THE DRAGON BONE SMASHER</h2><p></p><h2>How do you get red hot demon's soul?</h2><p>To give the Red Hot Demon's Soul</p><li>Must have the Searing Demon Soul in your inventory.</li><li>Select the talk option with him multiple times until you have exhausted all his dialog and he just repeats himself.</li><li>Must have defeated the Armor Spider and Flamelurker on the current playthrough.</li><h2>How do I get the blueblood sword?</h2>Availability. The Blueblood Sword is created by giving Blacksmith Ed the Pureblood Demon's Soul, which can be created from an un-upgraded Broken Sword. As with the other Boss Soul Weapons, Blacksmith Ed must have been given the Red Hot Demon's Soul beforehand.<h2>Is Meat Cleaver better than Dragon Bone Smasher?</h2>Firstly, it is worth noting that although opinions may differ, min-max SL125 Dragon Bone Smasher and Meat Cleaver builds can be considered roughly equivalent in terms of their potential effectiveness in both PvE and PvP. The same cannot be said of the Scimitar, Bastard Sword or many other weapons.<h2>What can the swollen demon soul be used for?</h2>The Swollen Demon's Soul can be used to ascend a Club or Great Club into the Meat Cleaver. It can also be used to purchase the miracle Regeneration from Saint Urbain. It can also be consumed for 13,200 souls.<h2>Does killing black phantoms increase World Tendency?</h2>Killing "named" NPC Black Phantoms increases your World Tendency towards White.<h2>How many people have died from pure black tendency?</h2>The primary way of lowering World Tendency is to die in Body Form. If a player dies while in this form, their World Tendency shifts towards black by -30%, meaning it only takes four deaths to go Pure Black from neutral.<h2>How do I get rid of black tendency?</h2>If you are in Human Form but want to avoid losing Tendency, go to the Nexus and jump off the high staircase to kill yourself and return to Phantom Form. Similarly, if you need to get any World to Pure Black Tendency repeatedly go into Human Form using Stone of Ephemeral Eyes, then kill yourself in that World.<h2>Is scraping spear good?</h2>The Scraping Spear's special ability is that it reduces the durability of enemy equipment with every successful attack. Landing enough attacks can cause the enemy's equipment to break, reducing their damage or defense. This has no effect on monsters, but can be useful against invaders and other humanoids.<h2>What does Flamelurker soul do?</h2>The Soul of the Demon " Flamelurker ". It radiates a strong power… Grants the holder a large number of Souls when used. Alternatively, it can be made into spells, miracles, or weapons.<h2>Does killing Garl Vinland affect character tendency?</h2>Killing Garl Vinland in either his Body Form or Black Phantom form won't have any effect on World Tendency or Character Tendency.<h2>How do I get the sword at Dragon God?</h2>This weapon is upgraded using Colorless Demon's Souls and can only be found in Pure White World Tendency, in the very bottom of the Stonefang Mines, by entering the inner sanctum of the Dragon God's temple and immediately turning left down a rubble-strewn corridor; the sword is partially buried under some rocks.<h2>What's the best build in demon souls?</h2>When playing through Demon's Souls for the first time, the Pure Strength build is what we recommend the most. If you focus on increasing your Vitality, Strength, and Endurance and wield a weapon with both hands, your attack power will be considerably boosted.<h2>What should I upgrade Knight demon souls?</h2><p>Demon's Souls: Tips For Playing As A Knight</p><ul><li>Choose The Right Shield. ...</li><li>Use Items To Increase Strength. ...</li><li>Use A Spear. ...</li><li>Upgrade Endurance Early. ...</li><li>Avoid The Slow Roll. ...</li><li>Learn To Parry Or Attack With A Shield. ...</li><li>Don't Rule Out Using Magic. ...</li><li>Find Regenerative Items.</li></ul><h2>How do you prevent Adjudicator tongue?</h2>Upper Level Strategy<p>The Adjudicator's weak spot from up here is his head, specifically the brown bird nesting in his crown.
