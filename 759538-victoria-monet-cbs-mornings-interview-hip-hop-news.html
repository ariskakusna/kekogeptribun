Earlier this month video made the rounds online of her enjoying herself at a club <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">with Janelle Monae and Teyana Taylor</a>. And just a few weeks later she was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">out with Megan Thee Stallion</a>, who was grinding on her in advance of an explosive beef with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> that erupted last week.
