Hughley recently spoke with Jason Lee of Hollywood Unlocked, and their conversation ranged across a lot of topics. However, one of the most salient and notable points of their interview emerged through the topic of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DJ Khaled</a>. Moreover, Hughley believes that Khaled has completely and erroneously ignored the conflict between Israel and Palestine that is resulting in all-out war. For those unaware, the We The Best Music mogul's family is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">from Palestine, and despite his constant presence on social media, he's yet to really speak out</a> about this mass and deliberate loss of life in the region with his huge platform.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So, I’ll see you exalting God when you make a shot," D.L. Hughley remarked concerning DJ Khaled's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">typical social media activity</a> in contrast to what other people are saying about the war in Gaza online. "But I’ll watch a seven-year-old Palestinian boy who is praying to God for the strength to bear that his family had been killed. I’ll watch you pray to not hit a bunker and then I will watch a Palestinian family pray that they can find one.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Then, the stand-up comedian referenced a recent viral video of DJ Khaled's security guards <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">carrying him over sand so he wouldn't get his Jordans dirty</a>. "We’re used to Palestinians being carried," he said. "They’re just not alive. They’re dead and they don’t have shoes, they don’t even have feet. To me, you have gone from DJ Khaled to DJ Callous. You cannot be so oblivious that you forget that the images that you are portraying have an equal and opposite effect. And what it tells people is that if somebody that looks like them doesn’t care, why should you?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to CNN, over 32,000 people have died so far in this recent resurgence of the centennial conflict, with the great majority being Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs posited that 576,000 of Gaza's residents, a quarter of their population, are "one step away from famine," with food crises and lack of proper medical care and mobility affecting the entire region. Many in the entertainment world continue to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">advocate for a ceasefire</a> and to rebuild after this destruction.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbH93hJRmm6Nlm52urbHDZqeapJWowaq6xGaemrKRYrGteceunqGkla56sbvPZpqupKSqv6Z5zZ6urA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-benavidez-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David Benavidez Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cynthia-nixon-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cynthia Nixon Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
