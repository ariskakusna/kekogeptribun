At least, that’s what Zoë Kravitz&nbsp;would have you believe as she was joined by <a href=# id=auto-tag_denzel-washington_1 data-tag=denzel-washington>Denzel Washington</a> this week for the unveiling of her father <a href=# id=auto-tag_lenny-kravitz_1 data-tag=lenny-kravitz>Lenny Kravitz</a>‘s star on the <a href=# id=auto-tag_hollywood-walk-fame_1 data-tag=hollywood-walk-fame>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Four-time Grammy winner Kravitz was honored Tuesday with the star but got roasted by his daughter, who took the opportunity to gently mock her dad, the rock star and style icon.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’ve seen the way you show up and take care of the people you love,” the Big Little Lies actress said from the podium. “I’ve seen your incredible dedication to your art. But mostly, I’ve seen through your shirts. According to my dad, if it doesn’t expose your nipples, it’s not a shirt. And sure, it used to embarrass me when you pick me up from school as a kid, but I gotta say at this point, I respect it.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The younger Kravitz managed to blend humor with heart as she paid tribute to the rock icon, whose string of hit songs — including “It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over,” “Are You Gonna Go My Way” and “Fly Away” — cemented him in rock history. And he won the Grammy for best male rock vocal performance award four years in a row from 1999 to 2002. His daughter attributed this success to his joie de vivre while honoring him on Tuesday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“What’s cool about you is not what people think is cool about you. Your radness doesn’t come from your shades or leather pants or knitted shirts. It comes from your true love of life,” she said of her dad. “Everything you do is an expression of that love, your music, your lyrics, your live performances, your homes, your love of food. A family of good conversations, stupid jokes, dance parties, late-late-night kitchen talks. You absolutely devour life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Channing Tatum, Earth Wind and Fire’s Verdine White and actor Evan Ross were among the stars who attended the event where Oscar-winner Washington had kind words for the elder Kravitz, who Washington said has been one of his best friends for decades.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When he was seven, I met him,” Washington told the crowd. “God has blessed him with an unbelievable talent but even more so and unbelievable heart. He’s a giver a lover. We’re close friends. We are brothers. I love Lenny Kravitz. I love Lenny Kravitz. I love Lenny Kravitz like I’ve loved no other brother in my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kravitz moved to Los Angeles from New York City when he was 10 with his family and launched his career initially under the moniker Romeo Blue. In 1985, he met The Cosby Show and A Different World actor <a href=# id=auto-tag_lisa-bonet_1 data-tag=lisa-bonet>Lisa Bonet</a>, with whom he had his only daughter. He released his debut album Let Love Rule in 1989 on Virgin Records; it was a moderate hit stateside but found instant success in Europe.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kravitz’s career has thrived and his fame grew larger over the following decades, and he has since become known for his hip personal style. In 2003, he launched Kravitz Design Inc., which focused on creative direction for commercial and residential products. In 2012, he took the role of creative stylist, Cinna, in the first two&nbsp;Hunger Games&nbsp;films. The rock star appeared alongside pop icon Katy Perry at the 2015 Super Bowl XLIX halftime show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to his Walk of Fame induction, Kravitz is among this year’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.rockhall.com/2024-nominees-announced rel=nofollow>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees</a>. The rocker was awestruck by Tuesday’s honor, saying: “To see my name. Lenny Kravitz, permanently engraved on the same streets I used to walk is a surreal indescribable feeling.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Bhsq%2B62Gaiq5mmnsG7edGomKyslZl6u7vEZqKrmaaewbt5x6ijpbGnpLyledaao6Rln5t6p63MnmSsrJGnenJ%2Bkm5vbmpkaYRw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./272924-lil-dicky-breaks-down-raps-best-basketball-players-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Dicky Breaks Down Rap's Best Basketball Players</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kevin-frankish-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kevin Frankish Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
