According to him, his fiancée Zelie Timothy had broken up with him, claiming that he included too many tracks about his ex-wife Samantha Lee on his latest project, Beautiful Pain. Previously, he revealed that the album was largely inspired by their rocky divorce. “Me and Zelie just broke up over some d*mb sh*t,” he explained. “She demanded that I cancel my ALBUM because there’s too many songs about my ex on there.. f*ck does that even mean?”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Luckily for Tyrese, however, the two of them were able to make a mends pretty quickly. Yesterday (February 14), he hopped on Instagram once again to share that they've gotten back together. He unveiled a carousel full of sweet photos of the two of them together, showing off their <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rekindled romance.</a></p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyrese-amp-zelie-timothy-celebrate-valentine-s-day>Tyrese & Zelie Timothy Celebrate Valentine's Day</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"If apologizing would’ve taken me another two weeks, I would’ve did it because you’re worth it. I’m sorry babe," he captioned the carousel. "I love you happy Valentines. @zelietimothy you ARE <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the BEAUTY that I've discovered in my pain</a>…. Tyrese.Tv is live for only 8 more hours…… She's giving me dirty looks now writing this loooonnngggg a** caption lol." As expected, the speedy reconciliation has left commenters confused, as it was only a couple of days ago that Tyrese announced their breakup publicly. Nonetheless, fans appear to support the reunion.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clearly, the embattled lovebirds didn't let the brief intermission get in the way of their holiday. "We lock’d in," Zelie commented on the post alongside a gold key emoji. What do you think of Tyrese and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Zelie Timothy</a> getting back together only a few days after announcing their split?
