Fans know that Burd has left a lasting impression on the Sway In The Morning squad, having laced a pair of memorable freestyles during his time in the booth. Here, he's foregoing the bars and talking shop, taking the opportunity to break down the hip-hop hierarchy of basketball talent and his lofty place within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After expressing that making the NBA is the only one of his childhood dreams yet to manifest, Heather B suggests hitting up the Celebrity All-Star Game as a litmus test. "I haven't played in that game yet," says Dicky. "I've been waiting cause I really just want to be ready. When I play in that game I'm going to score like, thirty-six points." His claim is met with incredulity, with Heather straight up saying it won't happen. "First off, it's the NBA celebrity game," retorts Dicky. "Honestly, everybody sucks in that game. They all suck!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/52/35/603552_fd59a0494f96956bcb1d433accf3b1b6.jpg><p><h6>Andrew Toth/Getty Images</h6></p><p>Sway claims that neither Quavo, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Common</a>, nor <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chris Brown</a> suck, which Dicky agrees with.&nbsp;"But that's borderline it," says Dicky, though he does give Kevin Hart props for being athletic. "I've never played with him, but I know for a fact if he really D'd me up it'd be hard to do stuff on him," says Dicky, his phrasing on-brand with his moniker. "He's probably very annoying."</p><p>When Heather B mentions <a href=# class=text-word rel>2 Chainz</a>, Dicky admits that Tity is nice but seems more comfortable in a mentorship role these days. "He doesn't play in the game that often," explains LD. "I was just in a game with 2 Chainz and he was like coaching, cause he didn't want to run around a lot. He's a great coach though. He put me in the right position, I thrived in that game. I had like sixteen points. I played really well. I think everybody would say I was the most impressive part of that game." Sway seems unconvinced, prompting Dicky to up his intensity. "Ask Chris Brown if I'm impressed at basketball," he challenges. "I'm one of the best rappers that play basketball, no question."&nbsp;</p><p>"J Cole looks really good," he continues, spelling out the hierarchy of rap basketball elite. "I've never been on the same court with him but I know he's good. Chris Brown, definitely good. Quavo, definitely good. I think right about there, Common is good. I haven't played with [<a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>] but <a href=# rel>he looks alright</a>. I feel like I could beat Drake, but he's probably so much stronger than me. It depends how they want to play one-on-one. If he's going to back me down and put me all the way under and he's really good at finishing. But I don't really fear Drake on the basketball court."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdibH96fpNmo6KkXZm2pLfYZpmrnZGgwG6wzrClZqqRpcBursSsq2aakai4psDBmqOlZaChrrqx0axkp52nqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lily-james-lyonesse-after-party-dress-boasted-2023s-chicest-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lily James' Lyonesse after-party dress boasted 2023's chicest trend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lenny-kravitz-roasted-zoe-kravitz-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-1235852447.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lenny Kravitz Honored With Star on Hollywood Walk of Fame</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
