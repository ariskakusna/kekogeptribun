His parents</span></strong></h3><p><span>Royalty’s parents are hip-hop legend Chris Brown and former model Nia Guzman.&nbsp;The latter became pregnant with the singer in 2014 after a brief affair between them.&nbsp;The friendship between Nia and Chris, who were friends for years before the pregnancy, did not lead to marriage as the two quit before their baby arrived.</span></p><p><span>Chris learned he was the father of Nia’s baby in 2015 after a DNA test proved the child came from his kidneys.&nbsp;At the time, Brown was in a long-term relationship with American model and actress Karrueche Tran, who dumped him immediately after publicly acknowledging that Royalty Brown was his child.</span></p><p><span>Royalty’s father was born Christopher Maurice Brown to Clinton Brown (a local correctional officer) and Joyce Hawkins (a former daycare director) on May 5, 1989, in Tappahannock, Virginia.</span></p><p><span>The iconic singer was raised with his older sister, Lytrell Bundy, who is a banker.&nbsp;Brown is famous for his roles in the music industry as much as assaulting his barbaric singer, songwriter, actress and singer Rihanna in 2009.</span></p><p><span>The R&B singer’s admission of guilt in the case earned him five years of probation and six months of community service.&nbsp;During his musical career, he released eight studio albums, one hundred and six singles, eight mixtapes and nine promotional singles.&nbsp;Chris Brown’s major musical influence is Michael Jackson.</span></p><p><span>Royalty’s mother, Nia, was born Nia Amey, in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States on July 22, 1883. She first received public attention due to her intimate relationship with Chris Brown.&nbsp;Guzman, who acts as a model, is a student nurse and currently lives in Los Angeles, California, United States.</span></p><p><span>In August 2016, she lost custody of her daughter following a court ruling that placed Royalty in the custody of her parents.&nbsp;The court also ordered Nia to reimburse the R&B singer for attorney fees it previously awarded her.</span></p><h3><strong><span>2. His net worth</span></strong></h3><p><span>The star kid’s fortune is estimated at $160 million, according to reports.&nbsp;Many believe that the child was able to accumulate this stunning figure thanks to the celebrity status of his parents.</span></p><p><span>Royalty has a clothing line known as Royalty Clothing Line.&nbsp;Her mother reportedly registered an international class 25 trademark under her daughter’s name in May 2017. The children’s fashion line deals with footwear, clothing and headwear.&nbsp;Chris Brown’s daughter also has a fast growing website titled: www.royaltybrown.com where she sells accessories, cosmetics and other accessories suitable for children under 5 years old.</span></p><h3><strong><span>3. Health Challenge</span></strong></h3><p><span>Royalty Brown suffers from asthma.&nbsp;His mother made this known in January 2016, claiming that her child indirectly developed the inflammatory condition as a result of the smoke she inhaled from&nbsp;</span><span>Run</span><span>&nbsp;crooner’s weed.&nbsp;Nia has always maintained that Brown was a bad influence on their daughter.&nbsp;She warned the rapper to quit smoking around Royalty as it was seriously affecting his health.</span></p><h3><strong><span>4. Body measurements</span></strong></h3><p><span>Royalty Brown is very beautiful, like her parents.&nbsp;Although the super-child is still growing and has many achievements ahead of her, her beauty has already started to “scream”.&nbsp;From her charming face to her amazing body structure, Royalty will one day take over the beauty world.</span></p><p><span>His height is put at 0.54 meters while his weight is not available online at the moment.&nbsp;His measurements are also not known but will be available at the right time – so sit back and wait for him.</span></p><h3><strong><span>5. Favorite animal</span></strong></h3><p><span>The famous child’s favorite animal is a rabbit.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiqn66urcDYZpmrp6ejeqS00aKqZpqipMSvv4ydmK6fmKmys3nBoqZmmZ6ZeqbCxKuwraCZo7Ruxc6uZKedlZl6tbuMpKWor18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sharon-osbourne-daughter-aimee-emotional-tribute-famous-dad.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sharon Osbourne's ultra-private daughter Aimee shares emotional message to famous dad Ozzy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ronnie-spector-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ronnie Spector Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1591822-highest-jamb-score-delta-utme-result-16-year-boy-smashed-2024-exam-surfaces.html>&amp;quot;The Highest JAMB Score in Delta&amp;quot;: UTME Result of 16-Year-Old Boy Who Smashed 2024 Exam Surfaces</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./reformation-black-friday-sale-2023.html>21 Best Reformation Cyber Monday Deals 2023 Get 25% Off Every Item</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-leather-trench-coats.html>24 Best Leather Trench Coats Inspired by Celebrity Street Style</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alex-pierce-death-resident-of-crown-point-indiana-lifelong-passed-away-html.html>Alex Pierce Death: Resident Of Crown Point Indiana Lifelong Passed Away</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-things-to-do-ibiza.html>An It Girl's guide to Ibiza: How to have a seriously luxe stay on the world-famous party island</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 PicoVibe.
