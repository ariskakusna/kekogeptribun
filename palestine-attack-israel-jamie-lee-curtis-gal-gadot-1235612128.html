The Associated Press reports that at least 22 U.S. citizens are confirmed to have been killed and are also among the 150 taken hostage by Hamas.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gadot, who has spoken out in support of Israel in the past, posted a screenshot to her Instagram account on Saturday, of a news story that stated that Israeli soldiers and civilians had been taken hostage by militants. In the caption, she wrote that “at least 250 Israeli have been murdered and dozens of women children and elders held as hostages in Gaza, by Palestinian military group Hamas.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She continued, “Starting early morning more than 3,000 rockets were fire. Hamas is holding hostages, controlling bases and settlements in Israel. There have been more than 1,500 injured and heavy fighting is still ongoing. ‘I hear their voices and they are banging on the door. I am with my two little children.’ My heart is aching.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In his own lengthy post about Israel, longtime manager Guy Oseary wrote that Hamas told anyone who has a gun or any weapon to get it out and use it because “today the best and most honorable history starts.” He shared a video of a young woman named Noa who was at a music festival when she was shot at and kidnapped.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“This is horrific.. these murders are being celebrated by the government/regime in Iran,” he wrote in the caption. “Many women, children and elderly are being taken from their homes and kidnapped. I have always prayed for peace. ALWAYS. I have always spoken up for my Jewish community and have also spoken up for my Arab brothers and sisters. I have no words today. Only heartbreak. Only tears.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Curtis and Schumer reposted Oseary’s post and added some of their own words, with the Everything Everywhere All at Once star sharing, “My hands in yours.” She also posted an image of scared children, captioned “terror skies.” Curtis later deleted this post.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Jewish people are the only group not allowed to defend themselves,” Schumer wrote below Oseary’s caption. “This has nothing to do with the occupation. Hamas don’t want end to occupation. They want to eradicate Israel. They’re funded by Iran, who are trying to destroy the peace deal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Oseary reposted his video a day later after he claimed both that clip and one “of another Israeli girl being kidnapped” were taken down by Instagram.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Bruno Mars was scheduled to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Saturday night, but the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>concert was canceled</a> following Hamas’ attack. In an Instagram post, Live Nation’s Israel account shared the news in a post in Hebrew translated to English, noting that all ticket purchases will be refunded to the credit card they came from. “We strengthen the residents of Israel, IDF fighters and the security forces in these difficult moments,” the post concluded.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Sunday, Natalie Portman, who was born in Jerusalem and has been <a href=#>outspoken on issues affecting Israel</a>, shared a statement on Instagram, writing, “My heart is shattered for the people of Israel. Children, women and the elderly have been murdered and abducted from their homes. I am in horror at these barbaric acts and my heart is pounding with love and prayer for the families of all affected.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a href=# rel=nofollow>On Monday’s edition of CBS Mornings</a>, co-host Tony Dokoupil noted that his 11- and 14-year-old children from his previous marriage both live in Israel with their mother, but they’re safe, he said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s been a very long weekend, and it’s been a very tough situation,” Dokoupil said. “First of all, I want to say thank you to everybody: our colleagues, friends who reached out to us and asked how I’m doing, how’s my family’s doing … It’s tough.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He said he had been in touch with his kids amid the conflict.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“As a father, I think people who could understand if somebody, anybody is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard whether they are struck or not, you’re gonna feel a thing or two,” he said. “So it’s been a roller coaster weekend.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He later shared more of his personal feelings on what happened.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’ve been sad and angry and disgusted to see the news that unfolded,” he said. “We’re talking about the direct, close-range murder of more than 700 civilians in their cars and their homes, at a festival. And then the kidnappings and then the hostage-taking, and then the evidence of rape. I think there’s enough moral clarity in the world to say this is wrong, it’s terrorism. And if it’s being done in your name, speak up. Speak up.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Referring to his co-host Gayle King’s question of “how did it come to this,” Dokoupil said, “I’m disappointed that 75 years after the United Nations and the world said ‘Jews [and] Arabs, live in peace, divide up the land, two countries,’ that two people have been unable to do so. And so three generations now have been living through war and terror and trauma and now, it’s my kids. It’s other people’s kids. What’s the solution here? What now?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">King also told Dokoupil she wondered if he would come in on Monday given the situation with his family.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I had to be here at work today,” he said. “But I also want to be clear with our viewers that I come to this fairly as a journalist. But I’m also a father. You can’t separate those two at a certain point.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the following days following the unprecedented surprise attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, more in Hollywood have taken to speaking out, including Sarah Silverman, Reese Witherspoon, Dwayne Johnson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gigi Hadid</a> and more.
