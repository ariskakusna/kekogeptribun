Dee Dee, who raised Gypsy Rose to believe that she was mentally and physically disabled, is thought to have had Munchausen syndrome by proxy.</p><p>A little background: Dee Dee told Gypsy Rose and their community that Gypsy was fatally ill with leuekemia, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, and host of other illnesses. In truth, Gypsy was perfectly healthy. When Gypsy found out, she conspired with her online boyfriend, Nicolas Godejohn, to kill her mother, and Dee Dee was found stabbed to death in her home. (Godejohn is now in prison for a first-degree murder sentence; Gypsy is serving her own sentence for second-degree murder.)</p><p>Living in Missouri with just Dee Dee, a woman who was as much a captor as she was a mother, Gypsy Rose didn't have many people she could confide in. But she did manage to find Lacey (AnnaSophia Robb) as she's called in&nbsp;The Act.&nbsp;In real life, Gypsy's friend's name is Aleah Woodmansee, and she was a neighborhood friend of Gypsy's.</p><p>According to the 2016 longform&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>BuzzFeed article</a>&nbsp;that has served as source material for multiple adaptations, Aleah Woodmansee was one of the few people, if not the only person, to know about Gypsy's internet boyfriend. Woodmansee was the first to inform investigators of Gypsy's co-conspirator when investigators searched their home following the murder. It seems that Woodmansee knew Gypsy's secrets, and gave her a safe space to tell them.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hulu.com/start referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=42392&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstart" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=hulu.com data-merchant-id=110180 data-merchant-url=hulu.com data-merchant-network=LS>Sign up for Hulu to watch 'The Act'</a></p><p>The two communicated through a Facebook account Gypsy created under the alias Emma Rose. “This is my personal account my mom is still overprotective so she don’t, know about this account,”&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Gypsy wrote</a>.
