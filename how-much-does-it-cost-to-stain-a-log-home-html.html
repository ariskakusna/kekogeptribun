In accordance with national estimates, the cost of remodelling a log house may vary from around $15,000 to more than $100,000. In addition, the procedure might be time-consuming.</p><p></p><h3>When should a log cabin be stained, and how often?</h3><p>3 to 7 years of age</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=149></span><p></p><h3>There were 36 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>Are log homes a high-maintenance investment?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>It is true that the majority of traditional log houses need a significant amount of care. Log houses may settle and check (crack) with time, and many will have bug problems (because of moist wood). Caulking and chinking are required as a consequence of the high volume of maintenance required.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=150></span><h3>What is the expected lifespan of a log home?</h3><p>between the ages of 20 and 50</p><p></p><h3>In order to stain a door, how much should I charge?</h3><p>How Much Does it Cost to Stain a Wood Door? Cost to Stain a Wood Door by Zip Code Square Feet Low to Midrange Installing a stain on a wood door will cost between $116.00 and $121.00. Between $158.00 and $165.00 A Wood Door to Be Staining Costs Between 161 and 173 Dollars Total Costs Between 223 and 243 Dollars Staining a Wood Door Staining a Wood Door – Total Average Cost per Square Foot of the Door $11.65 $8.35 $11.65</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=151></span><h3>A log home’s sealant should be applied on a regular basis?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>For example, after your whole house has been properly sealed, the south and west walls will almost always need re-coating first before anything else (often within 3-5 years). The outer walls on the north and east sides of the house are more shielded from UV rays and weather, and they may only need resealing every 5-8 years.</p><p></p><h3>Is it necessary to chink all log homes?</h3><p>Chinked log houses are very universally found. Yes, even ‘chinkless’ log houses generally contain some type of chinking in the corners and around the edges. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to locate a craftsman who still follows the traditional practise of true form-fitting notchwork. Because of time restrictions, commercial builders seldom take the time to thoroughly air season their logs.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=152></span><h3>What is the best way to stain a log cabin home?</h3><p>Staining your cabin is more than just an aesthetic decision; it is also a necessary protective measure to ensure that the outside of your property lasts for the duration of your ownership. Prepare the outside of your home. Make sure you follow the directions. Apply the first layer of paint. Checks or cracks in the caulk. Continue to apply additional coats and/or chinking, as required.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><h3>What is the going rate for staining decks in your area?</h3><p>It normally costs between $540 and $1,050 to stain a deck, with an average of little over $700 being spent on the project. For labour and supplies, this corresponds to an average cost of $2 to $4 per square foot of floor space. Higher-quality stains, as well as pre-staining treatments such as cleaning or sealing the wood, can increase the cost.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=153></span><h3>What is the best stain to use on log siding and how do I choose one?</h3><p>The best log home and cabin stains are those that outlast the others. Q8 Log Oil is a high-quality log oil. Seal-Once Premium Wood Sealer is an environmentally friendly product. Capture Log Stain is a stain that is used to capture logs. Clear Top Coat from Cascade. Staining Logs and Timbers to Transform Them Siding and trim have been transformed using transformation stain. X-100 Natural Seal is a natural sealant. Organiclear Log Stain is a clear stain that is organic in nature.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><h3>What exactly are the issues with log homes?</h3><p>The following are the most often encountered log house issues: Planting shrubs or plants too near to walls should be avoided. If you plant or prune plants or shrubs next to log walls, they will naturally draw moisture and will cause moisture damage to the logs. Rain should be diverted via gutters, overhangs, and trenches. Keep the sealant on your log cabin in good condition. Ground wetness should be avoided.</p><p></p><h3>Is it difficult to sell log homes?</h3><p>Despite the fact that they have a rustic beauty, the distinctive appearance may not be appealing to the majority of purchasers. In addition, log houses need a different level of care and upkeep than typical homes, which might be a source of worry for some. If you fall in love with a property that has been designated as difficult to sell, this does not always imply that you should walk away from the deal.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><span data-ez-ph-id=154></span><p></p><h3>Is it true that log houses are more durable than normal ones?</h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Using correct construction and sealing techniques, log houses may be 30 percent more energy efficient than the building rules in effect as of 2015. It is possible to make log houses that are correctly planned and constructed 15 percent to 20 percent more energy efficient than homes constructed with more contemporary building materials.</p><p></p><h3>Are log houses comfortable to live in?</h3><p>If log cabins are constructed properly, they may be very warm all year. In frigid areas such as Canada and Alaska, there exist a large number of log cabins. A conventional log cabin, on the other hand, does not need insulation since the logs themselves serve as insulation.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the best way to clean a log cabin before staining it?</h3><p>For both new construction and weathered wood, use the following formula: First, carefully clean the wood with water to remove any dirt or mill glaze that may have accumulated. After thoroughly soaking the whole surface, apply a 2 oz. solution. Once this is done, let it lie on the wood for around 10-15 minutes, depending on the degree of the discoloration.</p><p></p><h3>Is it true that log houses are less expensive than ordinary dwellings?</h3><p>Compared to traditional construction, are log or timber frame homes more expensive to buy and maintain. The succinct answer: The simplest, but not really helpful, response is yes. Regardless of who makes the logs or wood frame, this is true in all cases. If all you want is a place to sleep, traditional construction is the most cost-effective option.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfY6hprBlnaqwqXnDqJysZZmpeqS70q1kraddqMGitc1mmGakn5x6qbvMnmWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-jeanne-moutoussamy-ashe-make-latest-jeanne-moutoussamy-ashe-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe Make?
