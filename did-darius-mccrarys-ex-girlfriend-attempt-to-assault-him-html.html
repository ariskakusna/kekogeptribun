The reason? McCrary failed to appear on the scheduled hearing date. However, he later explained that he felt “displaced” and had to escape from his ex’s presence. In court documents, McCrary revealed that he is “emotionally scarred” and unable to focus on his work or daily activities due to fear. Shockingly, he claims that the abuse he endured included physical, verbal, and mental torment, and he suspects the use of narcotics in these abusive acts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Past Marital Struggles</strong></h3><p>Darius McCrary’s love life has been far from smooth sailing, marked by multiple relationships and marriages that ended in turmoil.

However, their union quickly soured, with Brawner accusing the actor of domestic abuse. In her divorce petition to the Los Angeles Superior Court, she described him as “violent, destructive, and emotionally unstable.” She further alleged that he neglected their child and struggled with substance addiction.
